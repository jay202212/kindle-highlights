You can’t kill a weed unless you get the roots out. Stomping on it, or chopping off what grows above ground, only yields a temporary result. This is likely what’s happened with your most common trading mistakes. Whatever you’ve done hasn’t finished the job.

The problem with these work-arounds is that you’ve minimized your profitability as well as your ability to adapt and improve as a trader. Trading smaller, exiting earlier, and booking a profitable day all in an effort to keep your emotions in check is not how you ultimately want to play this game. Yes, they can be good short-term strategies, but they’re best used like training wheels. And until you lose the training wheels, your upside potential as a trader is significantly limited.

Don’t fight your emotional state. Instead, treat emotions as signals and get curious about what they’re trying to tell you. We do this all the time when it comes to physical ailments. And, like our emotions, sometimes the real cause is not always obvious.

You’re learning a system that will not only help you to fix your current mental game problems but future ones as well. Using this system will become a skill in itself that enables you to continually refine your mental game when new issues pop up. For instance, a fear of losing may be the issue you’re looking to solve now, while later on, greed or overconfidence might become a problem.

When performing at an A-game level, your emotions are clear and stable. You’re in the zone, or close to it, so you make high quality decisions because there’s no negative emotional interference with your process.

In your B-game you’re likely making some marginal tactical errors—things that you need to improve but aren’t super obvious. If it were obvious, that would make it a C-game error. You’ll find some emotions holding you back from being in your A-game, but not enough to pull you down into your C-game.

Trading is hard enough without devoting mental energy to fight to control your emotions. It’s draining, and in the long term, makes it impossible to reach your potential as a trader. The end goal to strive for is resolution. Resolution means you have corrected the performance flaws causing your trading errors, permanently. Automatically, the things that would have triggered anger, greed, fear, etc., simply don’t anymore. You no longer need to manage, control, or work around your emotional reactions, because they are gone.

Think about this initial emotion like a reflex. It’s the equivalent of a doctor hitting your knee with a rubber mallet or your instinct to catch a ball thrown at your face. It’s a split-second reaction. There’s no conscious thinking involved. A snap of the fingers, and boom, emotions spike.

For instance, two hours into a trading day that started poorly, the possibility of an entry comes up and triggers a mixture of tension, excitement, and stress. You may also think, Don’t mess this up! You immediately lean closer to your screen and second-guess the validity of what you’re seeing. Instantly, your thoughts, emotions, and physical state have changed. Then comes your response. If your next thought is, Relax, I’ve got this, you’re fighting the reaction. If it works, it will reduce your emotions and improve execution. If, however, your next thought is, Don’t mess this up, or I can’t lose money here again, those thoughts produce secondary emotions that can lead to a downward spiral.

The reality is, emotions are messy. They build up in both the short term and the long term. And while the brain has a natural digestion process for emotion, sometimes there’s residual emotion left over—this is accumulated emotion. Despite trying to put the previous day’s losses and emotional chaos behind you, by perhaps telling yourself, “Today is a new day,” you aren’t really starting fresh. You don’t have a reset button or a clean slate to work from. Lurking beneath your optimism, emotions are accumulating, day over day.

From a performance standpoint, you care less about the emotions released after the trading day ends, since they have no bearing on your results that day. However, you care very much about the emotion that carries over and impacts your performance the following day. If your baseline emotion doesn’t reset completely, and you start with, say, 10% more emotion, your map needs to account for this in your pre-market warmup. An extra 10% may not seem like much, but it’s enough to prevent you from reaching your optimal level of performance. More consequentially, it’s enough to force you to work harder to maintain control—increasing the odds you’ll fail.

But imagine if, over the next few days, your results continue to slump or rise at an outsized pace. Your emotions can continue to build and build.

During the trading session, keep a working document nearby to capture new details so you don’t forget them. Afterward, review and consolidate your notes so you’re better prepared for the next session. Work like this every day for one to two weeks.

try setting a timer to go off at some regular frequency that isn’t too disruptive (i.e., every 15, 30, or 60 minutes). At that time, take a moment to be aware of your thought process, examine how you’re feeling, and see if there are any signs of a problem.

Recognition Doesn’t Equal Control While mapping allows you to see your emotions in real time more clearly, that doesn’t mean you can control them. For some of you that can be hard to comprehend—how can you see something and not be able to stop it? But the emotions behind your mistakes are intense. They’re fueled by a well-worn pattern that has a momentum all to itself and, once triggered, the most likely outcome at this point is that it will continue to the typical conclusion.

THE INCHWORM CONCEPT The Inchworm Concept is literally based on the inchworm, a caterpillar that moves in a distinct way. If you’ve never seen the way an inchworm moves, it starts by stretching its body straight, anchoring the front “feet,” and then lifting up from the backend. It then bends at the middle to bring the two ends closer together, anchors the back feet, and then stretches its body straight again to take another step forward. An inchworm looks like a bell curve that moves.

Consistent improvement as a trader has to include a commitment to eliminating your weaknesses. Otherwise, you’ll succumb to one of the most common problems I see: a wide range. The solution to that is a narrow range, which is achieved by maintaining a consistent focus on correcting the flaws in your C-game. This steady focus is a trait that elite performers in any industry share, including traders. They understand that the power to compete at the highest level comes first from the strength of the weakest part of their game, both technically and mentally.

The key to moving your Inchworm forward is sucking less in key moments when your C-game is likely. You must take advantage of these opportunities because it can transform your trading. Those moments are challenging. Emotions often run high, and it’s easy to lose sight of the long-term reality. The more you succumb to those mistakes, the better you get at making them. Learning is never neutral. Plus, there’s a direct relationship and connection between your peak and the strength of the backend of your Inchworm. By sucking less in those moments, you make it easier to get in the zone.

Throughout the trading day, Brian was constantly envisioning a future with a lot of money, where he was trading from the Caribbean and living an island lifestyle. This dream was a persistent distraction that took away the focus and urgency he needed each day to materialize that vision. He’d skip out on his pre- and post-market routines and avoid watching videos to expand his trading acumen. During the trading day, he’d get distracted and then just walk away and do something unrelated to trading. The emotions came in seemingly random fashion. There would be periods where greed would kick in. Brian would feel on top of the world, and he’d take position sizes that were too big, assuming they would never lose. At other times, he was so fearful of losing or making a mistake, he would only take perfect setups and therefore missed a lot of opportunities. Once he was in a trade, he’d be too focused on PnL, rather than price action, and couldn’t let the trade play out. He’d either quickly take profit or panic-sell once it retraced, because he didn’t want to lose. Or those missed opportunities would spark FOMO and he’d try to pick its top or bottom, only to get stopped out for going against momentum.

In our first session, the Inchworm Concept immediately resonated, and Brian realized that he was stalled out because he wasn’t actively trying to move forward. “It’s really hard to go forward if you are stretched out flat,” he noted. That led us to create weekly goals that were achievable, with daily benchmarks to measure progress. This allowed him to break out of the need to make money now, and focus instead on a daily process of sucking less. For Brian, the concept of not having to be perfect, to just be 10% less bad, clicked, and reduced the severity of his procrastination.

STEP 1: Describe the problem in detail. To begin, write down what you would say if you were describing the problem in your mental game to me. If you’ve already been building a detailed map of the problem and the clues surrounding it, use this step to clearly articulate the problem. You may also want to add in some details about the history of the problem, as context can be important for completing the next few steps. For example, if this problem started six months ago, after you had a significant life change—like getting divorced or having a child. That would indicate something different vs. if being unable to accept big losses had been a problem throughout your professional career. STEP 2: Explain why it makes sense that you have this problem, or why you think, feel, or react that way. Clients often have trouble with this step, and they think the answer is, “I’m just being irrational or illogical.” That is another way of saying that you are the problem. But then, is the solution to fix you? What does that even mean? It doesn’t make sense. You’re not the problem. The flaws, biases, and illusions are the cause of problem, and this step is critical to nailing down

Describe the problem in detail: I can’t accept big losses. Explain why it makes sense that you have this problem, or why you think, feel, or react that way: My strategy is profitable when I follow it. Explain why the logic in Step 2 is flawed: By saying that my strategy is profitable, I’m implying that I will never incur big losses, whether or not I perfectly execute my strategy. Come up with a correction to that flawed logic: I must learn how to take a loss. Take the punch. Embrace the feeling—losses taken with good execution are part of the deal. Explain why that correction is correct: A profitable strategy will incur losses, sometimes big ones. My edge accounts for that. The bigger problem is allowing a big loss to cost more than it should.

THE NATURE OF GREED In trying to understand the nature of greed, it’s helpful to look at Merriam Webster’s definition: “a selfish and excessive desire for more of something (such as money) than is needed.” Since we’re discussing this from a performance standpoint, and not from a societal one, we can remove the beginning and end of the definition. That leaves the phrase “an excessive desire for more,” which perfectly summarizes the problem. Greed is the emotion that indicates the point where your ambition becomes excessive.

Greed exists in every competitive arena. While the aspiration of athletes to win wouldn’t be characterized as greedy, that doesn’t mean they aren’t greedy while competing. But as observers, we can’t say with certainty which decisions are greedy or not. Intent matters. Consider the athlete who tries to make a big play—like a lineman in football attempting to pick up a fumble and run with it, or a baseball player trying to score from second base on a short single to center field, with two outs in the bottom of the ninth of a tied game. Whether or not they’re successful, if they assessed the risk as usual, then a healthy ambition and drive to win is likely what drove the decision. If, on the other hand, there is a drive to achieve personal glory above the aims of one’s team, or a need to prove to the skeptics that they deserve to be classed as a professional, then it’s likely some level of greed has affected the decision.

COMMON SIGNS OF GREED When ambition reaches a point where decision-making becomes compromised, that’s greed. You start focusing more on the money and your account balance, rather than the percentage or price action.

MAPPING YOUR GREED In those moments when you cross the line and make decisions that are counter to what you know is correct, you’re not making a conscious choice. Greed has taken control, and you’re compelled to take the trade, stay in it, add to it, take on more leverage, or squeeze out every tick. Emotions are powerful, especially greed, and to have a chance at correcting them, you need to map the signals that indicate an escalation.

What situations typically cause you to become greedy? How does your body react? For example, are you jacked up, ready to fight, or hyper-focused? Can you describe the point where ambition becomes excessive and turns into greed? What specifically is going through your mind? What thoughts do you have? How is your decision-making process different? What is the earliest sign that greed has become a problem? Mapping greed is an iterative process. When you spot new details, even just slight adjustments, be sure to add them. Small details matter, and can make the difference between making progress or not. Step 2 Now, you’re going to organize your notes into a chart that assigns a level of increasing severity, using a scale from 1 to 10, to each observation you’ve made. For instance, ranking something with a 1 would characterize a slight urge to force results, while ranking something a 10 would indicate unrestrained greed. At each level, identify details that clearly distinguish it from the other levels. As you assign levels of severity, split them into two categories: the mental and emotional side of greed, and the technical side. They sit side by side, so level 1 on the mental and emotional side corresponds to level 1 on the technical side, and so on. Be sure to base this on your personal experience of greed. Everyone

Rodrick on the other hand, a trader from the U.S. with a decade of experience trading all the global CME products, U.S. stocks, and forex, had a much more visible version of greed. He’s an incredibly hard worker who would react very poorly to a loss or mistake. Immediately, he would force trades, trying to take more than the market was giving him. He would try to recover, but spiral out of control, ultimately losing a lot of money on the day. Conversely, on the days where he made money easily, he would want to make even more. No amount was enough. When greed showed up for Rodrick, he would attempt to earn without a proper edge or system. He knew this, and initially assumed that worrying about money for life and bills was the problem. He tried putting away all the money that he’d need for an entire year to take care of himself and his family, but that didn’t change a thing. “Perhaps it’s a gap in knowledge,” he speculated. That idea drove him deeper into the markets, trying to gain more and more knowledge, and yet no matter how much more he learned, his greedy attempts to make money continued. As we began our work, it became quickly apparent that what Rodrick thought was greed was actually anger. He hated to make mistakes, and in his mind, losing was a mistake. He expected to make money on every trade, to trade better and make more money, and to never miss an opportunity. Failing to meet any of these expectations meant that he wasn’t perfect, which triggered an explosion of anger.

Another common source of fear that isn’t driven by a performance flaw is having a weak or incomplete trading strategy. Higher amounts of uncertainty are inevitable when you are less clear on how you make money, what trades to take, or whether a loss was due to a mistake or bad luck.

Ideally the role of anxiety and fear is to highlight that something is wrong or unknown with your read of the market, your positions, or how your strategy lines up with the market. If that’s what’s happening, it means your mental game is solid and largely free of the flaws, beliefs, or illusions that typically cause fear. For many of you, however, that isn’t the case. You may, for example: Worry about blowing up Consistently size too small, especially in positions that you sense could be home runs Stay out of trades, concerned about getting it wrong Constantly think about going broke Avoid trades that have the potential to be very volatile To get a clearer look at exactly what you’re facing, first rule out that it’s not a consequence of the normal competitive nerves or a weak trading plan. Once you’ve done that, it’s time to dive into what may be driving your fear.

If you’re going to resolve the issues causing your fear, you need to first understand where fear in trading comes from. At a basic level, fear can be reduced to uncertainty. Yes, that’s overly simplistic. But think about it this way: When you have certainty, you don’t have fear. The unknown is taken out of the equation.

Of course, there is no trading fairy. Yet some traders can take even heavy losses and not experience fear. How are they able to do that? What they have in common is certainty. They are so certain their strategy will pay off, they simply aren’t worried about the short-term losses. They can also be certain in their ability to find a way to make money, adapt if market conditions change, or develop a new strategy. Certainty is the antidote to fear. I’m not suggesting the end goal is to always have certainty. That’s not even practical. Instead, I’m suggesting that certainty and fear can’t coexist, and uncertainty is the breeding ground for fear.

Risk aversion is essentially a natural reaction to protect yourself from the pain associated with negative outcomes. It’s no different than how you’d instinctively raise your arms to protect yourself if someone tried to punch you in the face. Now instead, if you were about to get punched by a two-year-old child, how likely is it that you would instinctively put your arms up as a defense (except in exaggerated fashion to make the kid laugh)? With no threat of pain, there’s nothing to fear. This is important to distinguish, because it’s likely that risk aversion doesn’t happen on every trade.

Overthinking When functioning in an optimal state, thinking is controlled. You want to think; you think. You want to think about a particular topic; you think about that topic. Sure, some random ideas may come to mind, or your thoughts may go in unpredictable directions, but when you want to stop thinking, either in general or about a particular topic, you can do that easily.

Quick Tip: Writing is a great tool to work around the limitations of the mind. As overthinking creates confusion and clutter in your mind, writing helps you to find answers more efficiently. When you recognize that your thinking is getting out of control, whether during the trading day or afterward, write down what you’re worried about, and why. Being able to see and read your thoughts can give you a different perspective.

Quick Tip: Write down, in detail, your optimal decision-making process. Then when you start to second-guess a decision, ask if what you’re reconsidering needs to be part of that process or whether it’s excessive and driven by fear. Second-guessing is worse when there are holes in your decision-making. Clearing up that process makes second-guessing less likely, and then when it does occur, you get a clearer look at the fear that’s driving it.

The tension builds between wanting to trust your gut and being uncertain what it is, why it’s right, and worrying if it’s wrong. Plus, under pressure, you naturally retreat to what you know best: your standard way of making trades. So just like the advice from a stranger, your gut-level decisions are discarded as untrustworthy.

Quick Tip: Your gut is most accurate when you’re in the zone or operating at a high level. That doesn’t mean that, in that state, it’s always right, but when you’re in your C-game, your gut is almost certainly wrong or based on some biased view, not on an accurate sense about the potential opportunity. Learn to identify the qualitative differences between this and how you think and feel when your gut tends to be accurate. For example, one client noted that his gut is accurate when it seems like several puzzle pieces come together all at once—there’s a feeling of knowing combined with mental clarity. And when it’s incorrect, he feels tension in his chest and stomach, and his mind is filled with “what if” type questions. Making this distinction has made it significantly easier to trust his gut.

“What if” type questions are commonly associated with negative predictions. What if I lose another $50k? What if I can’t turn it around? What if I blow my account again? These aren’t really questions. You aren’t legitimately asking yourself what will happen. You’ve already assumed those negative outcomes will happen. If you’re on edge to begin with, that pseudo question triggers secondary fear, making additional mistakes and losses—and the negative future you fear—a more likely reality. Quick Tip: Rather than allow a “what if” scenario to run wild, treat it as a legitimate question and write down your answer. If that were to happen, what would it mean and what would you do? Playing out the fear like this can clarify what you are actually afraid of, and can help to uncover the hidden flaws contributing to it.

Force yourself to stay on the sidelines to intensify your emotions. The reason to do this is that when your emotions are more intense, the cause of them can be easier to identify. How might this look in practice? Define a narrower set of criteria for what trades you’ll take; for example, by only taking A+ trades for a day, a few days, or a week. Or you might deliberately remove some discretionary-type trades that can lead to FOMO. Keep a notepad or journal open next to you and, in real time, capture the emotions and thoughts that arise. They will be the clues to help you complete a more precise map, laying the groundwork for you to determine the roots of your FOMO and come up with a correction. If you find yourself hesitating about the financial impact of this exercise, remember this is research. You’re investing in a long-term upgrade to your execution that, if successful, will likely recoup those short-term missed opportunities many times over.

Pain of Losing Losing is painful enough that you can fear the feeling of losing itself. Traders tend to be ultra-competitive. While you know it’s not possible to profit from every trade, you don’t like losing. Losing money never feels good. Losing sucks and some traders reflexively try to avoid the pain of it, similar to how they would immediately, instinctively, limp to avoid the pain of a badly sprained ankle. The fear of losing is essentially protection from the pain of losing, and the equivalent of limping is quickly taking profit, sizing smaller, or avoiding higher risk trades.

There are better ways to reduce the pain of losing. But on some level, for people who are highly competitive, the pain will always be there. It will never feel good. And that’s fine. The goal then becomes more about how to handle the pain. Since you’ll never eliminate the pain of losing entirely, you must learn to push yourself through it by realizing the pain isn’t a problem. Imagine you’re a professional marathon runner who, just before a big race, feels a sharp pain in your left foot when you run. As you wait for the doctor to give you the results of an MRI, thoughts circle in your mind about having to pull out of the race or, worse, having an injury that requires surgery and will take months to fully heal. You get good news, though. While the injury does require surgery, you won’t make it worse running in this race. You just have to endure the pain. For you, losing may always be painful, but so what? It’s simply a result of your competitiveness and your desire to win. Don’t fall into the trap of assuming that pain equals something bad. Sometimes pain is just pain and you have to keep going.

Believing, either consciously or unconsciously, that unrealized gains were yours altered your perspective and caused you to panic. If you avoid getting attached to money that isn’t yours, you’ll automatically remain clear-minded in the trade. The correction here is less about correcting the fear and more about identifying the reason why you get attached to money that isn’t yet yours. So why do you? Does it happen as you come out of a drawdown and you’re relieved to be out of it? Are you overeager to hit your goals, reach higher, and never want to take steps backward? Are you a newer trader who didn’t really understand the difference between realized and unrealized profit?

To correct this problem, write down the reasons why your past failures happened. Use that knowledge to develop a well-thought-out plan to achieve your goals this time around. Another thing to consider is whether the worst-case scenario is really that bad. Research has shown that people tend to overestimate the duration and severity that tragic events have on our happiness and quality of life.1 This term was coined the “impact bias,” by Dan Gilbert,

This bias also applies to tragic events, like the loss of a limb or becoming paraplegic. You would think that compared to winning the lottery, losing a limb or the use of your legs would be much worse on your psyche. But you would be wrong. Their research shows that within a year of those extreme events, most people’s level of happiness returned to the level it was prior.

In other words, if the worst case were to actually happen, you’ll find a way to make sense of it and move forward. Going through it won’t be fun, but it also won’t be that bad. You can’t know what’s going to happen in the future, positive or negative. However, regardless of what happens, you’ll do everything you can to come out better on the other side, just like you’ve done in the past.

FEAR OF MISTAKES For some traders, mistakes are an integral part of the learning process. So, on one level, fearing mistakes essentially means that you fear learning. No one in their right mind would actually fear something so beneficial. But that’s the point: In the moment when the fear of mistakes shows up, you’re not in your right mind.

As the Inchworm Concept shows us, perfection is a moving target that will never be attained consistently. Aspire to perfection; don’t expect it. Mistakes are inevitable. The goal is to learn from them faster. I’m also not implying that you should lower your expectations. That’s not the correction. Instead, transform your expectations into aspirations or goals. When you aim toward perfection, rather than expecting it, you automatically treat mistakes in the correct way—as essential for growth. You expect mistakes to be part of the process, and your goal is to correct them as quickly as possible.

After getting a strong handle on the self-criticism side of the problem, you’re in position to break through the fear. But unlike the dog, you can’t just replace your inner critic (the owner). Breaking through the fear is a two-fold process. First, after making a mistake, you must work to decrease your anger. Second, assuming your anger level was lower, pay extra attention to that progress, and push yourself to trust that you can handle the next mistake better. If you’re organized and focused, you can create a cycle that can rapidly build trust.

Four to five times per year Alex identified trades where he had high confidence that he should be making a large bet, but the fear of being wrong prevented him from doing it. He was paralyzed by thoughts like What if I lose a big chunk? I don’t want to lose that much. What if I’m wrong? I don’t want to crash like that. He would pay more attention to business news and soliciting opinions from other traders, even when he knew it didn’t help. These trades set up over days, and his mind went into overdrive—overweighting the risk of danger and discounting the value of being right. With 20% of his trades driving 80% of his profits, Alex knew that individual trades could have a huge impact, but he couldn’t size these trades at a level commensurate with the opportunity. In our first session, we found our first piece of the problem. To Alex, the fear of being wrong in these big spots meant that his edge had disappeared. Under normal circumstances he could easily explain his core competency in 60 seconds. But if asked to do that while feeling the pressure of a big trade opportunity, his

This was the first gap in his process, and I encouraged him to spend time thinking about his strategy, accomplishments, and capability as a trader, so he could clearly explain why he would be right when he would spot these potential home runs. The exercise was easy to do, and writing down the numerous ideas flying around in his head added clarity to what constitutes his edge. Consolidating his knowledge like this created certainty around what he was doing, which automatically shielded him from anxiety. The clarity he gained from the exercise gave him the idea to experiment with cutting off all external sources of information. The first few days were weird, but then he noticed a big increase in his mental capacity. He was able to focus longer and didn’t drift off. This second improvement in his process quickly led to a third. The absence of external information forced him to focus exclusively on his own opinions and intuition. The latter allowed him to increase his competency around his intuition, so he could tell the difference between it and the voices of doubt that held him back. He

This experience is in stark contrast to fear, which included overthinking and doubtful questioning, as well as a very physical reaction: tightness in his chest and a knot in his stomach. Having these points written out, side by side, allowed him to see the difference in real time, and act accordingly.

This pattern of overestimating your control usually starts with big wins. You had some trades where you got in and out at the perfect time and made the maximum on the trade. At that time, two things happened: You didn’t consider positive variance, and, whether you realized it or not, assumed the outsized results were due solely to your skill as a trader. You started to believe that you should get maximum profit from every trade, or at least think it should happen more often.

Now, when you make less than the maximum, you see it as your having made a mistake, even if you made a decent profit. It may not be that black and white, but the more this happens, the more you start to hesitate and second-guess your entries and exits, risk calculations, or other inputs, because you don’t want to “make a mistake like that” again.

If you haven’t already completed an A- to C-game Analysis, write down all of the obvious mistakes and all the marginal (slightly less bad) mistakes you tend to make. If you can identify recent learning mistakes as well, great. If not, leave it blank. Then, the next time you think you’ve made a mistake, see where it fits on your lists. If it doesn’t fit as marginal or obvious, take some time to consider if the loss was a result of something that you didn’t understand, or something new that would enhance your current ability. If so, it’s likely a learning mistake, and fearing that kind of mistake is the mark of someone who’s afraid of learning.

Imagine you’re standing on top of a mountain that’s so high that you’re above the clouds. Everything below you is obscured, so it seems like you’re actually standing on a cloud. You’ve been there so long that you’ve forgotten that you’re standing on a mountain. It feels like there’s nothing solid beneath you and at any minute you could slip through the cloud and free-fall back to earth. But just then the cloud dissipates entirely, and you see the huge mountain beneath you. You are, in fact, on solid ground. The mountain is the base of knowledge that you’ve acquired as a trader. You’ve climbed to a high level. (Perhaps not yet as high as you want, but that’s ok.) When you ignore your competencies, you feel unstable when there’s no need to—you’ve simply lost sight of the bedrock beneath your feet, and that breeds fear. No matter how high you’ve climbed on your proverbial mountain, take some time to solidify what knowledge, skills, and experience has gone unrecognized, and you’ll improve your ability to handle uncertainty and reduce fear.

While the whole point of trading is to make money, greed actually costs you money. Your unrestrained desire to make more forces you into decisions that, in the long term, make you less successful. The market punishes your attempts to squeeze out every penny and make the maximum return from every trade. Of course, that’s not always the case—sometimes greed is rewarded with massive winners or perfect exits. But you wouldn’t be reading this if you didn’t think greed was a problem.

This was certainly true for Vishal, a trader from the U.K. who began trading about six years ago. He’s a trader who uses technical analysis to drive his decisions in the forex and futures markets. There’s also a strong discretionary piece to his strategy, where he uses intuition to decide if he’s going to take the trade or not. This is where Vishal was experiencing a lot of anxiety.

the turning point came when I pointed out that for him, right now, trading should be 10% mental and 90% technical. That brought him back to the basics, to where he realized the plan he was bringing into battle was not comprehensive enough. He couldn’t pull the trigger because he had too many unanswered questions. The doubt and hesitation were signals of weaknesses in his strategy. He became much more open-minded about his trading. Hesitation and losses, which used to cause a mix of criticism and additional fear, became opportunities to question the technical elements of the trade, refine his strategy, and become more systematic in his approach.

Asking “What am I doing wrong?” or “How could I have been so stupid?” presumes that you were wrong and stupid. Asking “When will I start making money again?” presumes you could possibly know that. Uncertainty is a core element in your profession. You need to embrace that fact so deeply, it’s as if it’s coded in your DNA. But as a trader struggling to control your fear, simply embracing uncertainty isn’t enough. You need to identify and correct the underlying flaws that force you to need certainty when you can’t have it yet.

Quick Tip: Only once you start to resolve fear, tilt, greed, or a confidence problem does it make sense to correct risk aversion. Otherwise you risk creating more chaos. Once you make progress, risk aversion will either automatically go away or you’ll need to push yourself to take more profitable risks. At first, that might take a leap of faith, so consider setting a specific amount of money to invest when pushing yourself to take more risks. Often just knowing that your potential losses are limited helps to free you from any aversion to risk. Overthinking When functioning in an optimal state, thinking is controlled. You want to think; you think. You want to think about a particular topic; you think about that topic. Sure, some random ideas may come to mind, or your thoughts may go in unpredictable directions, but when you want to stop thinking, either in general or about a particular topic, you can do that easily.

One of the reasons this happens is due to a limitation in a part of the brain, called working memory. Working memory is where you think. It’s where the voice in your head lives, and it’s like a whiteboard in your mind where you consciously put pieces together and work through problems. Under normal circumstances you have access to between five and nine pieces of information at one time in your working memory. This part of the brain is already limited, but anxiety and fear shrink that number even further. You struggle to answer the question driving your fear because you lack the space to consider all the relevant data. Imagine trying to complete a 1000-piece puzzle by only looking at three pieces at a time—your mind goes into overdrive in a desperate attempt to find the pieces needed to solve the problem. Quick Tip: Writing is a great tool to work around the limitations of the mind. As overthinking creates confusion and clutter in your mind, writing helps you to find answers more efficiently. When you recognize that your thinking is getting out of control, whether during the trading day or afterward, write down what you’re worried about, and why. Being able to see and read your thoughts can give you a different perspective.

Step 2 Once you’ve gathered a lot of details, organize what you’ve found by putting them in order of severity. Rank each detail on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 characterizes a slight doubt or worry, and 10 is what happens under the most intense amount of fear. At each level, identify details that clearly distinguish it from other levels.

My aunt worked several years in what Americans call “sweat shops.” It was hard work. Long hours, “small” wage, “poor” working conditions. Do you know what my aunt did before she worked in one of these factories? She was a prostitute. The idea of working in a “sweat shop” compared to that old lifestyle is an improvement, in my opinion. I know that my aunt would rather be “exploited” by an evil capitalist boss for a couple of dollars than have her body be exploited by several men for pennies. That is why I am upset by many Americans’ thinking. We do not have the same opportunities as the West. Our governmental infrastructure is different. The country is different. Yes, factory is hard labor. Could it be better? Yes, but only when you compare such to American jobs. I don’t know what to make of this. Part of me wants to argue, fiercely. Part of me wants to understand. But mostly it’s an example of how different experiences can lead to vastly different views within topics that one side intuitively thinks should be black and white.

Luck and risk are both the reality that every outcome in life is guided by forces other than individual effort. They are so similar that you can’t believe in one without equally respecting the other. They both happen because the world is too complex to allow 100% of your actions to dictate 100% of your outcomes. They are driven by the same thing: You are one person in a game with seven billion other people and infinite moving parts. The accidental impact of actions outside of your control can be more consequential than the ones you consciously take. But both are so hard to measure, and hard to accept, that they too often go overlooked. For every Bill Gates there is a Kent Evans who was just as skilled and driven but ended up on the other side of life roulette. If you give luck and risk their proper respect, you realize that when judging people’s financial success—both your own and others’—it’s never as good or as bad as it seems.

Benjamin Graham is known as one of the greatest investors of all time, the father of value investing and the early mentor of Warren Buffett. But the majority of Benjamin Graham’s investing success was due to owning an enormous chunk of GEICO stock which, by his own admission, broke nearly every diversification rule that Graham himself laid out in his famous texts. Where does the thin line between bold and reckless fall here? I don’t know.

Consider a rookie baseball player who earns $500,000 a year. He is, by any definition, rich. But say he plays on the same team as Mike Trout, who has a 12-year, $430 million contract. By comparison, the rookie is broke. But then think about Mike Trout. Thirty-six million dollars per year is an insane amount of money. But to make it on the list of the top-ten highest-paid hedge fund managers in 2018 you needed to earn at least $340 million in one year.14 That’s who people like Trout might compare their incomes to. And the hedge fund manager who makes $340 million per year compares himself to the top five hedge fund managers, who earned at least $770 million in 2018. Those top managers can look ahead to people like Warren Buffett, whose personal fortune increased by $3.5 billion in 2018. And someone like Buffett could look ahead to Jeff Bezos, whose net worth increased by $24 billion in 2018—a sum that equates to more per hour than the “rich” baseball player made in a full year. The point is that the ceiling of social comparison is so high that virtually no one will ever hit it. Which means it’s a battle that can never be won, or that the only way to win is to not fight to begin with—to accept that you might have enough, even if it’s less than those around you.

If something compounds—if a little growth serves as the fuel for future growth—a small starting base can lead to results so extraordinary they seem to defy logic.

Consider what would happen if you saved $1 every month from 1900 to 2019. You could invest that $1 into the U.S. stock market every month, rain or shine. It doesn’t matter if economists are screaming about a looming recession or new bear market. You just keep investing. Let’s call an investor who does this Sue. But maybe investing during a recession is too scary. So perhaps you invest your $1 in the stock market when the economy is not in a recession, sell everything when it’s in a recession and save your monthly dollar in cash, and invest everything back into the stock market when the recession ends. We’ll call this investor Jim. Or perhaps it takes a few months for a recession to scare you out, and then it takes a while to regain confidence before you get back in the market. You invest $1 in stocks when there’s no recession, sell six months after a recession begins, and invest back in six months after a recession ends. We’ll call you Tom. How much money would these three investors end up with over time? Sue ends up with $435,551. Jim has $257,386. Tom $234,476. Sue wins by a mile. There were 1,428 months between 1900 and 2019. Just over 300 of them were during a recession. So by keeping her cool during just the 22% of the time the economy was in or near a recession, Sue ends up with almost three-quarters more money than Jim or Tom.

Having a strong sense of controlling one’s life is a more dependable predictor of positive feelings of wellbeing than any of the objective conditions of life we have considered. More than your salary. More than the size of your house. More than the prestige of your job. Control over doing what you want, when you want to, with the people you want to, is the broadest lifestyle variable that makes people happy.

People like to feel like they’re in control—in the drivers’ seat. When we try to get them to do something, they feel disempowered. Rather than feeling like they made the choice, they feel like we made it for them. So they say no or do something else, even when they might have originally been happy to go along.25 When you accept how true that statement is, you realize that aligning money towards a life that lets you do what you want, when you want, with who you want, where you want, for as long as you want, has incredible return.

No one—not a single person out of a thousand—said that to be happy you should try to work as hard as you can to make money to buy the things you want. No one—not a single person—said it’s important to be at least as wealthy as the people around you, and if you have more than they do it’s real success. No one—not a single person—said you should choose your work based on your desired future earning power. What they did value were things like quality friendships, being part of something bigger than themselves, and spending quality, unstructured time with their children. “Your kids don’t want your money (or what your money buys) anywhere near as much as they want you. Specifically, they want you with them,” Pillemer writes.

The best part of being a valet is getting to drive some of the coolest cars to ever touch pavement. Guests came in driving Ferraris, Lamborghinis, Rolls-Royces—the whole aristocratic fleet. It was my dream to have one of these cars of my own, because (I thought) they sent such a strong signal to others that you made it. You’re smart. You’re rich. You have taste. You’re important. Look at me. The irony is that I rarely if ever looked at them, the drivers. When you see someone driving a nice car, you rarely think, “Wow, the guy driving that car is cool.” Instead, you think, “Wow, if I had that car people would think I’m cool.” Subconscious or not, this is how people think. There is a paradox here: people tend to want wealth to signal to others that they should be liked and admired. But in reality those other people often bypass admiring you, not because they don’t think wealth is admirable, but because they use your wealth as a benchmark for their own desire to be liked and admired.

But in reality those other people often bypass admiring you, not because they don’t think wealth is admirable, but because they use your wealth as a benchmark for their own desire to be liked and admired. The letter I wrote after my son was born said, “You might think you want an expensive car, a fancy watch, and a huge house. But I’m telling you, you don’t. What you want is respect and admiration from other people, and you think having expensive stuff will bring it. It almost never does—especially from the people you want to respect and admire you.” I learned that as a valet, when I began thinking about all the people driving up to the hotel in their Ferraris, watching me gawk. People must gawk everywhere they went, and I’m sure they loved it. I’m sure they felt admired. But did they know I did not care about them, or even notice them? Did they know I was only gawking at the car, and imagining myself in the driver’s seat? Did they buy a Ferrari thinking it would bring them admiration without realizing that I—and likely most others—who are impressed with the car didn’t actually give them, the driver, a moment’s thought? Does this same idea apply to those living in big homes? Almost certainly. Jewelry and clothes? Yep. My point here is not to abandon the pursuit of wealth. Or even fancy cars. I like both. It’s a subtle recognition that people generally aspire to be respected and admired by others, and using money to buy fancy things may bring less of it than you imagine. If respect and admiration are your goal, be careful how you seek it. Humility, kindness, and empathy will bring you more respect than horsepower ever will. We’re not done talking about Ferraris. Another story about the paradox of fast cars in the next chapter.

Modern capitalism makes helping people fake it until they make it a cherished industry. But the truth is that wealth is what you don’t see. Wealth is the nice cars not purchased. The diamonds not bought. The watches not worn, the clothes forgone and the first-class upgrade declined. Wealth is financial assets that haven’t yet been converted into the stuff you see.

We should be careful to define the difference between wealthy and rich. It is more than semantics. Not knowing the difference is a source of countless poor money decisions. Rich is a current income. Someone driving a $100,000 car is almost certainly rich, because even if they purchased the car with debt you need a certain level of income to afford the monthly payment. Same with those who live in big homes. It’s not hard to spot rich people. They often go out of their way to make themselves known. But wealth is hidden. It’s income not spent. Wealth is an option not yet taken to buy something later.

Diet and exercise offer a useful analogy. Losing weight is notoriously hard, even among those putting in the work of vigorous exercise. In his book The Body, Bill Bryson explains why: One study in America found that people overestimate the number of calories they burned in a workout by a factor of four. They also then consumed, on average, about twice as many calories as they had just burned off … the fact is, you can quickly undo a lot of exercise by eating a lot of food, and most of us do. Exercise is like being rich. You think, “I did the work and I now deserve to treat myself to a big meal.” Wealth is turning down that treat meal and actually burning net calories. It’s hard, and requires self-control. But it creates a gap between what you could do and what you choose to do that accrues to you over time.

More importantly, the value of wealth is relative to what you need. Say you and I have the same net worth. And say you’re a better investor than me. I can earn 8% annual returns and you can earn 12% annual returns. But I’m more efficient with my money. Let’s say I need half as much money to be happy while your lifestyle compounds as fast as your assets. I’m better off than you are, despite being a worse investor. I’m getting more benefit from my investments despite lower returns.

Everyone knows the tangible stuff money buys. The intangible stuff is harder to wrap your head around, so it tends to go unnoticed. But the intangible benefits of money can be far more valuable and capable of increasing your happiness than the tangible things that are obvious targets of our savings. Savings without a spending goal gives you options and flexibility, the ability to wait and the opportunity to pounce. It gives you time to think. It lets you change course on your own terms. Every bit of savings is like taking a point in the future that would have been owned by someone else and giving it back to yourself.

The thing that makes tail events easy to underappreciate is how easy it is to underestimate how things compound. How, for example, 9/11 prompted the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, which helped drive the housing bubble, which led to the financial crisis, which led to a poor jobs market, which led tens of millions to seek a college education, which led to $1.6 trillion in student loans with a 10.8% default rate. It’s not intuitive to link 19 hijackers to the current weight of student loans, but that’s what happens in a world driven by a few outlier tail events.

Technology is hard to predict because Bill Gates may have died from polio if Jonas Salk got cranky and gave up on his quest to find a vaccine. The reason we couldn’t predict the student loan growth is because an airport security guard may have confiscated a hijacker’s knife on 9/11. That’s all there is to it.

Uncertainty, doubt, and regret are common costs in the finance world. They’re often worth paying.

My parents lived their adult years in two stages: dirt poor and moderately well off. My father became a doctor when he was 40 and already had three kids. Earning a doctor’s salary did not offset the frugal mentality that is forced when supporting three hungry kids while in medical school, and my parents spent the good years living well below their means with a high savings rate. This gave them a degree of independence. My father was an Emergency Room doctor, one of the highest-stress professions I can imagine and one that requires a painful toggling of circadian rhythms between night and day shifts. After two decades he decided he’d had enough, so he stopped. Just quit. Moved onto the next phase of his life. That stuck with me. Being able to wake up one morning and change what you’re doing, on your own terms, whenever you’re ready, seems like the grandmother of all financial goals. Independence, to me, doesn’t mean you’ll stop working. It means you only do the work you like with people you like at the times you want for as long as you want.

All lifestyles exist on a spectrum, and what is decent to one person can feel like royalty or poverty to another. But at our incomes we got what we considered a decent apartment, a decent car, decent clothes, decent food. Comfortable, but nothing close to fancy.

There is always trading taking place, and as a trader you owe it to yourself to understand why it’s taking place and to figure out a way to make money off it. Learning what the market is telling you is very time consuming and difficult, but it gives you the foundation that you need to be a successful trader.

The most common successful reversals first break a trendline with strong momentum and then pullback to test the extreme, and if a trader focuses too much on divergences, she will often overlook this fundamental fact.

When you enter on a 5-minute chart, your trade is based on your analysis of the 5-minute chart without any idea of what the 1-minute looks like. You must therefore rely on your 5-minute stops and targets, and just accept the reality that the 1-minute chart will move against you and hit a 1-minute stop frequently. If you watch the 1-minute chart, you will not be devoting your full attention to the 5-minute chart and I will take your money from your account and put it in my account. If you want to compete, you must minimize all distractions and all inputs other than what is on the chart in front of you, and trust that if you do, you will make a lot of money.

The most useful tools for understanding price action are trendlines and trend channel lines, prior highs and lows, breakouts and failed breakouts, the size of bodies and tails on candles, and relationships between the current bar to the prior several bars. In particular, how the open, high, low, and close of the current bar compare to the action of the prior several bars tells a lot about what will happen next.

Trading through the rearview mirror is a sure way to lose money. You have to keep looking ahead, not worrying about the mistakes you just made. They have absolutely no bearing on the next tick, so you must ignore them and just keep reassessing the price action and not your profit and loss (P&L) on the day.

The most useful aspect of price action is watching what happens after the market moves beyond (breaks out beyond) prior bars or trendlines on the chart. For example, if the market goes above a significant prior high and each subsequent bar forms a low that is above the prior bar’s low and a high that is above the prior bar’s high, then this price action indicates that the market will likely be higher on some subsequent bar, even if it pulls back for a few bars near term.

On the other hand, if the market breaks out to the upside, and then the next bar is a small inside bar (its high is not higher than that of the large breakout bar), and then the following bar has a low that is below this small bar, the odds of a failed breakout and a reversal back down increase considerably.

debt instruments, and currencies. Why does price move up one tick? It is because there is more volume being bid at the current price than being offered, and a number of those buyers are willing to pay even more than the current price if necessary. This is sometimes described as the market having more buyers than sellers, or as the buyers being in control, or as buying pressure. Once all of those buy orders that can possibly be filled are filled at the current price (the last price traded), the remaining buyers will have to decide whether they are willing to buy at one tick higher. If they are, they will continue to bid at the higher price. This higher price will make all market participants re-evaluate their perspective on the market. If there continues to be more volume being bid than offered, price will continue to move up since there are an insufficient number of contracts being offered by sellers at the last price to fill the requests to buy by buyers. At some point, buyers will start offering some of their contracts as they take partial profits. Also, sellers will perceive the current price as a good value for a short and offer to sell more than buyers want to buy. Once there are more contracts being offered by sellers (either buyers who are looking to cover some or all of their long contracts or by new sellers who are attempting to short), all of the buy orders will be filled at the current price, but some sellers will be unable to find enough buyers. The bid will move down a tick. If there are sellers willing to sell at this lower price, this will become the new last price.

Since institutional activity controls the move and their volume is so huge and they place most of their trades with the intention of holding them for hours to months, most will not be looking to scalp and instead they will defend their original entry. If Vanguard or Fidelity have to buy stock for one of their mutual funds, their clients will want the fund to own stock at the end of the day. Clients do not buy mutual funds with the expectation that the funds will day trade and end up in all cash by the close. The funds have to own stock, which means they have to buy and hold, not buy and scalp. For example, after their initial buy, they will likely have much more to buy and will use any small pullback to add on. If there is none, they will continue to buy as the market rises.

Some beginner traders wonder who is buying as the market is going straight up and also wonder why anyone would buy at the market instead of waiting for a pullback. The answer is simple. It is institutions working to fill all of their orders at the best possible price, and they will buy in many pieces as the market continues up. A lot of this trading is being done by institutional computer programs, and it will end after the programs are complete.

When trading Countertrend against a strong trend, it is imperative to wait for the signal bar to close before you place your order, and then only enter on a stop at 1 tick beyond the bar in the direction of your trade (if you are buying, buy at 1 tick above the high of the prior bar on a stop).

Fibonacci retracements and extensions are a part of price action, but since most are just approximations and most fail, do not use them for trading. If one is good, it will be associated with a chart pattern that is reliable and tradable on its own, independent of the Fibonacci measurement or any indicators.

Larger bodies in general indicate more strength, but an extremely large body after a protracted move or a breakout can represent an exhaustive end of a trend, and no trade should be taken until more price action unfolds. A series of strong trend bars is the sign of a healthy trend and will usually be followed by a further extreme, even if a pullback immediately ensues.

The bulls can demonstrate stronger control by having the body be about the size or larger than that of the median body size over the past 5 or 10 bars. Additional signs of strength include the open being on or near the low, the close on or near the high, the close at or above the closes and highs of several prior bars, the high above the high of one or more prior bars, and the tails being small. If the bar is very large, it might represent exhaustion or a one bar false breakout that is trapping new bulls, only to reverse down in the next bar or two. The opposite is true for bear trend bars.

A beginner trader should only enter when the signal bar is also a trend bar in the direction of his trade. For example, if he is shorting, he should restrict himself to signal bars that are bear trend bars, because then the market has already demonstrated selling pressure, and the odds of follow-through are higher than if the signal bar had a close above its open. Similarly, when a beginner is looking to buy, he should only buy when the signal bar has a close above its open. Almost every bar is a potential signal bar, but the majority never lead to an entry, and therefore do not become signal bars. As a day trader, you will place many orders that never get filled. It is usually best to enter on a stop at one tick above or below the prior bar, and if the stop is not hit, cancel the order and look for a new location for an order. For stocks, it is often better to place the entry stop at a couple of ticks beyond the potential signal bar because one tick traps are common, where the market breaks out by only one tick and then reverses, trapping all of the traders who just entered on stops.

In general, signal bars that are doji bars or trend bars in the opposite direction of your trade have a greater chance of failure since the side of the market that you need to be in control has not yet asserted itself. It is always better to get into a market after the correct side (bulls or bears) have taken control of at least the signal bar.

When considering a Countertrend trade in a strong trend, you must wait for a trendline to be broken and then a strong reversal bar to form on the test of the extreme, or else the chances of a profitable trade are too small. Also, do not enter on a 1-minute reversal bar since the majority of them fail and become With Trend setups. The loss might be small, but if you lose four ticks on five trades, you will never get back to being profitable on the day (you will bleed to death from a thousand paper cuts).

Trading is inherently risky. To my knowledge, no trade has a guaranteed outcome; therefore, the possibility of being wrong and losing money is always present. So when you put on a trade, can you consider yourself a risk-taker? Even though this may sound like a trick question, it is not. The logical answer to the question is, unequivocally, yes. If I engage in an activity that is inherently risky, then I must be a risktaker. This is a perfectly reasonable assumption for any trader to make. In fact, not only do virtually all traders make this assumption, but most traders take pride in thinking of themselves as risk-takers. The problem is that this assumption couldn't be further from the truth. Of course, any trader is taking a risk when you put on a trade, but that doesn't mean that you are correspondingly accepting that risk.

There is a huge psychological gap between assuming you are a risk-taker because you put on trades and fully accepting the risks inherent in each trade. When you fully accept the risks, it will have profound implications on your bottom-line performance. The best traders can put on a trade without the slightest bit of hesitation or conflict, and just as freely and without hesitation or conflict, admit it isn't working. They can get out of the trade—even with a loss—and doing so doesn't resonate the slightest bit of emotional discomfort. In other words, the risks inherent in trading do not cause the best traders to lose their discipline, focus, or sense of confidence. If you are unable to trade without the slightest bit of emotional discomfort (specifically, fear), then you have not learned how to accept the risks inherent in trading. This is a big problem, because to whatever degree you haven't accepted the risk, is the same degree to which you will avoid the risk. Trying to avoid something that is unavoidable will have disastrous effects on your ability to trade successfully.

Trading presents us with a fundamental paradox: How do we remain disciplined, focused, and confident in the face of constant uncertainty? When you have learned how to "think" like a trader, that's exactly what you'll be able to do.

The best traders aren't afraid. They aren't afraid because they have developed attitudes that give them the greatest degree of mental flexibility to flow in and out of trades based on what the market is telling them about the possibilities from its perspective. At the same time, the best traders have developed attitudes that prevent them from getting reckless. Everyone else is afraid, to some degree or another. When they're not afraid, they have the tendency to become reckless and to create the kind of experience for themselves that will cause them to be afraid from that point on.

But when it comes to trading, your fears will act against you in such a way that you will cause the very thing you are afraid of to actually happen.

You don't have to know anything about yourself or the markets to put on a winning trade, just as you don't have to know the proper way to swing a tennis racket or golf club in order to hit a good shot from time to time. The first time I played golf, I hit several good shots throughout the game even though I hadn't learned any particular technique; but my score was still over 120 for 18 holes. Obviously, to improve my overall score, I needed to learn technique. Of course, the same is true for trading. We need technique to achieve consistency. But what technique? This is truly one of the most perplexing aspects of learning how to trade effectively. If we aren't aware of, or don't understand, how our beliefs and attitudes affect our perception of market information, it will seem as if it is the market's behavior that is causing the lack of consistency. As a result, it would stand to reason that the best way to avoid losses and become consistent would be to learn more about the markets.

a possible explanation for this phenomenon might be that people were getting into trading for the wrong reasons. THE ATTRACTION I had to pause for a moment to think about this. I agree that many of the typical reasons people are motivated to trade—the action, euphoria, desire to be a hero, the attention one can draw to himself by winning, or the self-pity that comes from losing—create problems that will ultimately detract from a traders performance and overall success. But the true underlying attraction to trading is far more fundamental and universal. Trading is an activity that offers the individual unlimited freedom of creative expression, a freedom of expression that has been denied most of us for most of our lives.

I'm sure you could list many things to do or be that you have absolutely no interest in. I know I could. You could also make another list of the things you are only marginally interested in. Finally, you could list everything you have a passionate interest in. Of course, the lists get smaller as the interest levels rise. Where does passionate interest come from? My personal view is that it comes from the deepest level of our being—at the level of our true identity. It comes from the part of us that exists beyond the characteristics and personality traits we acquire as a result of our social upbringing.

. I would say that many, if not most people, grow up in a family and cultural environment that gives little, if any, objective, nonjudgmental support to the unique ways in which we feel compelled to express ourselves. This lack of support is not simply an absence of encouragement. It can be as deep as the outright denial of some particular way in which we want to express ourselves. For example, let's look at a common situation: A toddler, who for the first time in his life, notices "this thing," which we call a vase, on the coffee table. He is curious, which means there's an inner force that's compelling him to experience this object. In a sense, it's as if this force creates a vacuum in his mind that has to be filled with the object of his interest. So, he focuses on the vase, and, with deliberate intent, crawls across the vast expanse of the living room floor to the coffee table. When he gets there, he reaches up to the edge of the table to pull himself to his feet. With one hand firmly on the table to maintain his balance, his other hand reaches out to touch this thing he has never experienced. Just at that moment, he hears a scream from across the room, "NO! DON'T TOUCH THAT!" Startled, the child falls back on his butt, and begins to cry. Obviously, this is a very common occurrence and one that is completely unavoidable.

In fact, learning what is safe and what isn't and the value of things are important lessons the child must learn. However, there are some extremely important psychological dynamics at work here that have a direct effect on our ability to create the kind of discipline and focus necessary to trade effectively later in life.

What happens when we're denied the opportunity to express ourselves in the way we want to, or we're forced to express ourselves in a way that doesn't correspond with the natural selection process? The experience creates an upset. Being "up-set" implies an imbalance. But what exactly is out of balance? For something to be out of balance, there has to be something that's in balance or in equal proportion in the first place. That something is the relative degree of correspondence that exists between our inner, mental environment and the exterior environment where we experience our lives. In other words, our needs and desires are generated in our mental environment, and they are fulfilled in the exterior environment . If these two environments are in correspondence with one another, we're in a state of inner balance and we feel a sense of satisfaction or happiness. If these environments are not in correspondence, we experience dissatisfaction, anger, and frustration, or what is commonly referred to as emotional pain.

What can put our mental environment back into balance? There are a number of techniques. The most natural one, especially for a child, is simply to cry. Crying is a natural mechanism (nature's way) for reconciling these denied, unfulfilled impulses. Scientific researchers have found tears to be composed of negatively charged ions. If allowed to take its natural course, crying will expel the negatively charged energy in our minds and bring us back to a state of balance, even though the original impulse was never fulfilled.

If we don't make the choice, we don't get to play. In trading, no one (except yourself) is going to force you to decide in advance what your risk is. In fact, what we have is a limitless environment, where virtually anything can happen at any moment and only the consistent winners define their risk in advance of putting on a trade.

For everyone else, defining the risk in advance would force you to confront the reality that each trade has a probable outcome, meaning that it could be a loser. Consistent losers do almost anything to avoid accepting the reality that, no matter how good a trade looks, it could lose. Without the presence of an external structure forcing the typical trader to think otherwise, he is susceptible to any number of justifications, rationalizations, and the kind of distorted logic that will allow him to get into a trade believing that it can't lose, which makes determining the risk in advance irrelevant.

gambling games have a formal ending, they force the participant to be an active loser. If you're on a losing streak, you can't keep on losing without making a conscious decision to do so. The end of each game causes the beginning of a new game, and you have to actively subject more of your assets to further risk by reaching into your wallet or pushing some chips to the center of the table. Trading has no formal ending. The market will not take you out of a trade. Unless you have the appropriate mental structure to end a trade in a manner that is always in your best interest, you can become a passive loser. This means that, once you're in a losing trade, you don't have to do anything to keep on losing. You don't even have to watch. You can just ignore the situation, and the market will take everything you own—and more.

If we start from the premise that to create consistency traders must focus their efforts on developing a trader's mind-set, then it is easy to see why so many traders don't succeed. Instead of learning to think like traders, they think about how they can make more money by learning about the markets. It's almost impossible not to fall into this trap. There are a number of psychological factors that make it very easy to assume that it's what you don't know about the markets that causes your losses and lack of consistent results. However, that's just not the case. The consistency you seek is in your mind, not in the markets.

It's attitudes and beliefs about being wrong, losing money, and the tendency to become reckless, when you're feeling good, that cause most losses—not technique or market knowledge.

Interestingly, most traders are closer to the way they need to think when they first begin trading than at any other time in their careers. Many people begin trading with a very unrealistic concept of the inherent dangers involved. This is particularly true if their first trade is a winner. Then they go into the second trade with little or no fear. If that trade is a winner, they go into the next trade with even less concern for what would otherwise be the unacceptable possibility of a loss. Each subsequent win convinces them that there is nothing to fear and that trading is the easiest possible way to make money. This lack of fear translates into a carefree state of mind, similar to the state of mind many great athletes describe as a "zone." If you've ever had the occasion to experience the zone in some sport, then you know it is a state of mind in which there is absolutely no fear and you act and react instinctively. You don't weigh alternatives or consider consequences or second-guess yourself. You are in the moment and "just doing it." Whatever you do turns out to be exactly what needed to be done. Most athletes never reach this level of play, because they never get past the fear of making a mistake. Athletes who reach the point where there is absolutely no fear of the consequences of screwing up will usually, and quite spontaneously, enter into "the zone." By the way, a psychological zone is not a condition you can will yourself into, the way you can will yourself into a feat of endurance. It is a state of mind you find yourself in that is inherently creative, and usually if you start thinking about your actions at a rational or conscious level, you pop right out of it. Even though you cannot force or will yourself into a zone, you can set up the kind of mental conditions that are most conducive to experiencing "the zone," by developing a positive winning attitude. I define a positive winning attitude as expecting a positive result from your efforts, with an acceptance that whatever results you get are a perfect reflection of your level of development and what you need to learn to do better.

When you're feeling confident and unencumbered by fears and worries, it isn't difficult to put on a string of winning trades because it's easy to get into a flow, a kind of natural rhythm, where what you need to do seems obvious or self-evident. It's almost as if the market screams at you when to buy and when to sell, and you need very little in the way of analytical sophistication. And, of course, because you have no fear, you can execute your trades with no internal argument or conflict. The point I am making is that winning in any endeavor is mostly a function of attitude.

Many people are certainly aware of this, but at the same time, most people don't understand the significant part attitude plays in their results. In most sports or other competitive activities, participants must develop physical skills as well as mental skills in the form of strategies. If opponents are not evenly matched in the skills department, the one with superior skills usually ("but not always) wins. When an underdog beats a superior opponent, what's the determining factor? When two opponents are evenly matched, what's the factor that tips the balance one way or the other? In both cases, the answer is attitude.

What happens when the novice trader finally does lose? What effect will it have on his carefree state of mind? The answers will depend on his expectations going into the trade and how he interprets the experience. And how he interprets the experience is a function of his beliefs and attitudes. What if he is operating out of a belief that there's no possible way to avoid a loss, because losing is a natural consequence of trading — no different from, let's say, a restaurant owner incurring the expense of having to buy food? Furthermore, suppose that he has completely accepted the risk, meaning that he has considered and accounted for all of what would otherwise be the unacceptable possibilities in the market's behavior, both financially and emotionally.

By the way, this is an example of an ideal set of trading beliefs and attitudes. Now suppose that he hasn't completely accepted the risk. What if his expectations didn't take into account any market behavior other than what he wanted? From this mental perspective, if the market doesn't do what he wants, he is going to feel pain—emotional pain.

We can safely assume that after a loss, our novice trader will be in a state of emotional pain. As a result, his trading will take on a whole new quality. He'll definitely lose that carefree state of mind, but more important, he will feel that the market did this to him: The market caused him to feel the pain he is experiencing; the market took away his winning feeling by subjecting him to a loss. Notice how our trader is blaming the markets for losing or what he didn't get.

Notice how our trader is blaming the markets for losing or what he didn't get. Notice, too, how natural it is to feel the way he does. Think about how many times in our lives, especially as children, we were doing something we really enjoyed, like playing with a toy or with our friends, and someone with more power and authority forced us to stop what we were doing and do something we didn't want to do. All of us have lost things, had things taken away from us, been denied things we wanted or believed we deserved, been prevented from continuing an activity we were in the middle of, or been blocked from pursuing an idea we were passionate about. The point is that in many of these situations, we did not need to take personal responsibility for what happened to us or for the pain we experienced, because we were powerless to do anything about it.

The bottom line is that, as adults when we get into a trading mode, we don't realize how natural it is to associate the instantaneous shift from joy to pain that we experienced so often as children with the same instantaneous shift from joy to pain that occurs when we trade. The implications are that if we haven't learned to accept the inherent risks of trading and don't know how to guard against making these natural connections between our past and the present, we will end up blaming the market for our results instead of taking responsibility for them.

In society, we can expect other people to behave in reasonable and responsible ways. When they don't, and if we suffer as a result, society makes remedies available to rectify the imbalance and make us whole again. The market, on the other hand, has no responsibility to give us anything or do anything that would benefit us.

However, if you ever find yourself blaming the market and feeling betrayed, that is essentially what you are doing.

From the market's perspective, each moment is neutral; to you, the observer, every moment and price change can have meaning. But where do these meaning exist? The meanings are based on what you've learned, and exist inside your mind, not in the market. The market doesn't attach meanings or interpret the information it generates about itself (although there are always individuals who will offer an interpretation if you're willing to listen). Furthermore, the market doesn't know how you define an opportunity or a loss.

Curiously, even though his knowledge has increased, he now finds that he's developed problems executing his trades. He hesitates, second guesses himself, or doesn't put on a trade at all, in spite of any number of clear signals to do so. It's all frustrating, even maddening, because what's happened doesn't make sense. He did what he was supposed to do—he learned—only to find that the more he learned, the less he took advantage of. He would never believe that he did anything wrong by devoting himself to learning; he simply did it for the wrong reasons.

Our minds have a number of ways to shield us from information that we have learned to perceive as painful. For example, at a conscious level, we can rationalize, justify, or make a case for staying in a losing trade. Some of the more typical ways we do this are to call our trading buddies, talk to our broker, or look at indicators we never use, all for the express purpose of gathering nonpainful information in order to deny the validity of the painful information. At a subconscious level, our minds will automatically alter, distort, or specifically exclude information from our conscious awareness. In other words, we don't know at a conscious level that our pain-avoidance mechanisms are either excluding or altering the information being offered by the market. Consider the experience of being in a losing trade when the market is making consistently higher highs and higher lows or lower highs and lower lows against your position, while you refuse to acknowledge you are in a losing trade because you have focused all your attention on the tics that go in your favor. On the average, you are only getting one out of four or five tics in your direction; but it doesn't matter because every time you get one, you are convinced the market has reversed and is coming back. Instead the market keeps going against you. At some point, the dollar value of the loss becomes so great that it cannot be denied and you finally exit the trade.

The first reaction that traders universally have when looking back at such a trade is, "Why didn't I just take my loss and reverse?" The opportunity to put on a trade in the opposite direction was easily recognized once there was nothing at stake. But we were blinded to this opportunity while we were in the trade, because at that time the information indicating it was an opportunity was defined as painful, so we blocked it from our awareness.

The problem is that preventing pain by avoiding losses can't be done. The market generates behavior patterns and the patterns repeat themselves, but not every time. So again, there is no possible way to avoid losing or being wrong. Our trader won't sense these trading realities, because he is being driven forward by two compelling forces: (1) he desperately wants that winning feeling back, and (2) he is extremely enthusiastic about all of the market knowledge he is acquiring. What he doesn't realize is that, in spite of his enthusiasm, when he went from a carefree state of mind to a preventand-avoid mode of thinking, he shifted from a positive to a negative attitude.

If I were to classify traders based on the kind of results they achieve, I would put them into three broad categories. The smallest group, probably fewer than 10 percent of the active traders, are the consistent winners. They have a steadily rising equity curve with relatively minor drawdowns. The drawdowns they do experience are the type of normal losses that any trading methodology or system incurs. Not only have they learned how to make money, but they are no longer susceptible to the psychological forces that cause the boomand-bust cycle. The next group, which consists of between 30 and 40 percent of the active traders, are consistent losers. Their equity curves are mirror images of the consistent winners' curves, but in the opposite direction— many losing trades with an occasional winner. Regardless of how long they have been trading, there's much about it that they haven't learned. They either have illusions about the nature of trading or are addicted to it in ways that make it virtually impossible for them to be winners. The largest group, the remaining 40 to 50 percent of the active traders, are the "boom and busters." They have learned how to make money, but they haven't learned there s a whole body of trading skills that have to be mastered in order to keep the money they make. As a result, their equity curves typically look like roller-coaster rides, with a nice, steady assent into a steep dropoff, then another nice, steady assent into another steep dropoff. The roller-coaster cycle continues on and on. I have worked with many experienced traders who have put together incredible winning streaks, sometimes going months without a losing day; having fifteen or twenty winning trades in a row is not unusual for them. But for the boom and busters, these streaks always end the same way—in huge losses that are the result of either euphoria or self-sabotage.

However, as soon as you put on the larger-than-usual position, you're in danger. The larger the position, the greater the financial impact small fluctuations in price will have on your equity. Combine the largerthan- normal impact of a move against your position with a resolute belief that the market will do exactly as you expect, and you have a situation in which one tic in the opposition direction of your trade can cause you to go into a state of "mind-freeze" and become immobilized.

If you believe the market did this to you, then you'll feel compelled to learn more about the market in order to protect yourself.

As your confidence grows, the more likely that at some point you will cross the threshold into euphoria and start the cycle all over again.

Did you ever wonder why leaving money on the table is often more painful than taking a loss? When we lose, there are any number of ways in which we can shift the blame to the market and not accept responsibility. But when we leave money on the table, we can't blame the market. The market didn't do anything but give us exactly what we wanted, but for whatever reason, we weren't capable of acting on the opportunity appropriately. In other words, there's no way to rationalize the pain away. You are not responsible for what the market does or doesn't do, but you are responsible for everything else that results from your trading activities.

As you can see, your fear and feeling of discomfort are completely justified and rational. Each of those possibilities becomes real the moment you contemplate interacting with the market. However, as true as all of these possibilities are for every trader, what isn't true or the same for every trader is what it means to be wrong, lose, miss out, or leave money on the table. Not everyone shares the same beliefs and attitudes about these possibilities and, therefore, we don't share the same emotional sensitivities.

Needing courage, nerves of steel, or selfcontrol would imply an internal conflict where one force is being used to counteract the effects of another. Any degree of struggle, trying, or fear associated with trading will take you out of the moment and flow and, therefore, diminish your results. This is where professional traders really separate themselves from the crowd. When you accept the risk the way the pros do, you won't perceive anything that the market can do as threatening. If nothing is threatening, there's nothing to fear. If you're not afraid, you don't need courage. If you're not stressed, why would you need nerves of steel?

The traders who break through the cycle and ultimately make it are the ones who eventually learn to stop avoiding and start embracing the responsibility and the risk. Most of those who successfully break the cycle don't make the shift in thinking until they have experienced so much pain from large losses that it has the positive effect of stripping away their illusions about the nature of trading. With respect to your development, the how of their transformation is not that important, because in most cases it happened inadvertently. In other words, they weren't completely aware of the shifts that were taking place inside their mental environment until they experienced the positive effects their new perspective had on the ways in which they interacted with the market. This is why very few top traders can really explain what accounts for their success, except to speak in axioms like "cut your losses" and "go with the flow."

a state of mind or perspective is like software code. You could have several thousand lines of perfectly written code, with only one flawed line, and in that one flawed line there might be only one character out of place. Depending on the purpose of the software and where that flaw is in relation to everything else, that one misplaced character could ruin the performance of an otherwise perfectly written system. You see, the solution was simple: Fix the misplaced character, and everything runs smoothly. However, finding the error or even knowing it exists in the first place can take considerable expertise.

Professionals don't perceive anything about the markets as painful; therefore, no threat exists for them. If there's no threat, there's nothing to defend against. As a result, there isn't any reason for their conscious or subconscious defense mechanisms to kick in. That's why professionals can see and do things that mystify everyone else. They're in the flow, because they're perceiving an endless stream of opportunities, and when they're not in the flow, the very best of the best can recognize that fact and then compensate by either scaling back or not trading at all.

in any given moment the environment is generating an enormous amount of information about its properties, characteristics, and traits. Some of that information is beyond the physiological range of our senses. For example, our eyes can't see every wavelength of light nor can our ears hear every frequency of sound the environment produces, so there's definitely a range of information that is beyond the physiological capabilities of our senses. What about the rest of the information the environment is generating about itself? Do we see, hear, taste, smell, or feel through our senses every possible distinction, trait, and characteristic being senses? Absolutely not! The energy that's inside of us will categorically limit and block our awareness of much of this information by working through the same sensory mechanisms the external environment works through.

a top trader would say that your fear is irrational because this "now moment" opportunity has absolutely nothing to do with your last trade. Each trade is simply an edge with a probable outcome, and statistically independent of every other trade. If you believe otherwise, then I can see why you're afraid; but I can assure you that your fears are completely unfounded.

As this next dog comes into contact with the boy's eyes or ears, if there is enough similarity between the way it looks or sounds and the dog that's embedded in his memory, then his mind will automatically connect the two. This connection, in turn, will cause the negatively charged energy in his memory to be released throughout his body, causing him to be overcome with a very uncomfortable sense of foreboding or terror. The degree of discomfort or emotional pain that he experiences will be equivalent to the degree of trauma that he suffered as a result of his first encounter with a dog.

Since the two dogs, the one in the boy's mind and the one outside of the boy's mind, feel exactly the same, it's extremely unlikely the boy will be able to make any type of distinctions in the second dog's behavior that would suggest to him that it is any different than the one in his mind. So, instead of perceiving this next encounter with a dog as an opportunity to experience something new about the nature of dogs, he perceives a threatening and dangerous dog. Now, if you think about it for a moment, what is it about this process that would indicate to the boy that his experience of the situation was not the absolute, unquestionable truth? Certainly the pain and fear that he experienced in his body was the absolute truth. But what about the possibilities that he perceived? Were they true? From our perspective, they weren't.

One of your basic objectives as a trader is to perceive the opportunities available, not the threat of pain. To learn how to stay focused on the opportunities, you need to know and understand in no uncertain terms the source of the threat. It's not the market. The market generates information about its potential to move from a neutral perspective. At the same time, it provides you (the observer) with an unending stream of opportunities to do something on your own behalf. If what you perceive at any given moment causes you to feel fear, ask yourself this question: Is the information inherently threatening, or are you simply experiencing the effect of your own state of mind reflected back to you (as in the above illustration)? I know this is a difficult concept to accept, so I'll give you another example to illustrate the point. Let's set up a scenario, where your last two or three trades were losers.

You are watching the market, and the variables you use to indicate that an opportunity exists are now present. Instead of immediately executing the trade, you hesitate. The trade feels very risky, so risky, in fact, that you start questioning whether this is "really" a signal. As a result, you start gathering information to support why this trade probably won't work. This is information you normally wouldn't consider or pay attention to, and it's certainly not information that is part of your trading methodology. In the meantime, the market is moving. Unfortunately, it is moving away from your original entry point, the point at which you would have gotten into the trade if you hadn't hesitated. Now you are conflicted, because you still want to get in; the thought of missing a winning trade is painful. At the same time, as the market moves away from your entry point, the dollar value of the risk to participate increases. The tug of war inside your mind intensifies.

The market gave you a signal. But you didn't perceive the signal from an objective or positive perspective. You didn't see it as an opportunity to experience the positive feeling you would get from winning or making money, but that's exactly what the market was making available to you. Think about this for a moment: If I change the scenario so that your last two or three trades were winners instead of losers, would you have perceived the signal any differently?

In each situation, the market generated the same signal. But your state of mind was negative and fear-based in the first scenario, and that caused you to focus on the possibility of failure, which in turn caused you to hesitate. In the second scenario, you hardly perceived any risk at all. You may even have thought the market was making a dream come true.

For the most part, a typical traders perception of the risk in any given trading situation is a function of the outcome of his most recent two or three trades (depending on the individual). The best traders, on the other hand, are not impacted (either negatively or too positively) by the outcomes of their last or even their last several trades. So their perception of the risk of any given trading situation is not affected by this personal, psychological variable.

There's a huge psychological gap here that might lead you to believe that the best traders have inherent design qualities in their minds that account for this gap, but I can assure you this is not the case.

THE "UNCERTAINTY" PRINCIPLE If there is such a thing as a secret to the nature of trading, this is it: At the very core of one's ability 1) to trade without fear or overconfidence, 2) perceive what the market is offering from its perspective, 3) stay completely focused in the "now moment opportunity flow," and 4) spontaneously enter the "zone," it is a strong virtually unshakeable belief in an uncertain outcome with an edge in your favor. The best traders have evolved to the point where they believe, without a shred of doubt or internal conflict, that "anything can happen."

As a result, you sense what the market is about to do as if there is no separation between yourself and the collective consciousness of everyone else participating in the market. The zone is a mental space where you are doing more than just reading the collective mind, you are also in complete harmony with it. If this sounds a bit strange to you, ask yourself how it is that a flock of birds or a school of fish can change direction simultaneously. There must be a way in which they are linked to one another.

The first is that you need absolutely no skill of any kind to put on a winning trade. For most traders it usually takes years of pain and suffering before they figure out or finally admit to themselves that there's more to being consistent than the ability to pick an occasional winner. The second reason is that you don't have to travel anywhere to trade.

but I think the percentage of traders who either consciously or subconsciously want to rid themselves of their money or hurt themselves in some way is extremely small. So, if financial suicide is not the predominant reason, then what could keep someone from doing something that would otherwise make absolute, perfect sense? The answer is quite simple: The typical trader doesn't predefine his risk, cut his losses, or systematically take profits because the typical trader doesn't believe it's necessary. The only reason why he would believe it isn't necessary is that he believes he already knows what's going to happen next, based on what he perceives is happening in any given "now moment." If he already knows, then there's really no reason to adhere to these principles. Believing, assuming, or thinking that "he knows" will be the cause of virtually eveiy trading error he has the potential to make (with the exception of those errors that are the result of not believing that he deserves the money). Our beliefs about what is true and real are very powerful inner forces.

Because anything includes everything, this belief will act as an expansive force on his perception of the market that will allow him to perceive information that might otherwise have been invisible to him. In essence, he will be making himself available (opening his mind) to perceive more of the possibilities that exist from the markets perspective. Most important, by establishing a belief that anything can happen, he will be training his mind to think in probabilities. This is by far the most essential as well as the most difficult principle for people to grasp and to effectively integrate into their mental systems.

Here's an interesting paradox. Casinos make consistent profits day after day and year after year, facilitating an event that has a purely random outcome. At the same time, most traders believe that the outcome of the market's behavior is not random, yet can't seem to produce consistent profits. Shouldn't a consistent, nonrandom outcome produce consistent results, and a random outcome produce random, inconsistent results? What casino owners, experienced gamblers, and the best traders understand that the typical trader finds difficult to grasp is: even that have probable outcomes can produce consistent results, if you can get the odds in your favor and there is a large enough sample size.

Here's what makes thinking in probabilities so difficult. It requires two layers of beliefs that on the surface seem to contradict each other. We'll call the first layer the micro level. At this level, you have to believe in the uncertainty and unpredictability of each individual hand. You know the truth of this uncertainty, because there are always a number of unknown variables affecting the consistency of the deck that each new hand is drawn from. For example, you can't know in advance how any of the other participants will decide to play their hands, since they can either take or decline additional cards. Any variables acting on the consistency of the deck that can't be controlled or known in advance will make the outcome of any particular hand both uncertain and random (statistically independent) in relationship to any other hand. The second layer is the macro level. At this level, you have to believe that the outcome over a series of hands played is relatively certain and predictable. The degree of certainty is based on the fixed or constant variables that are known in advance and specifically designed to give an advantage (edge) to one side or the other.

The constant variables I am referring to are the rules of the game. So, even though you don't or couldn't know in advance (unless you are psychic) the sequence of wins to losses, you can be relatively certain that if enough hands are played, whoever has the edge will end up with more wins than losses.

Trading also involves a number of unknown variables that act on the outcome of any particular behavior pattern a trader may identify and use as his edge. In trading, the unknown variables are all other traders who have the potential to come into the market to put on or take off a trade.

Since all trades have an uncertain outcome, then like gambling, each trade has to be statistically independent of the next trade, the last trade, or any trades in the future, even though the trader may use the same set of known variables to identify his edge for each trade. Furthermore, if the outcome of each individual trade is statistically independent of every other trade, there must also be a random distribution between wins and losses in any given string or set of trades, even though the odds of success for each individual trade may be in the traders favor.

At the micro level, they believe that each trade or edge is unique. What they understand about the nature of trading is that at any given moment, the market may look exactly the same on a chart as it did at some previous moment; and the geometric measurements and mathematical calculations used to determine each edge can be exactly the same from one edge to the next; but the actual consistency of the market itself from one moment to the next is never the same.

The typical trader won't predefine the risk of getting into a trade because he doesn't believe it's necessary. The only way he could believe "it isn't necessary" is if he believes he knows what's going to happen next. The reason he believes he knows what's going to happen next is because he won't get into a trade until he is convinced that he's right. At the point where he's convinced the trade will be a winner, it's no longer necessary to define the risk (because if he's right, there is no risk). Typical traders go through the exercise of convincing themselves that they're right before they get into a trade, because the alternative (being wrong) is simply unacceptable. Remember that our minds are wired to associate.

As a result, being wrong on any given trade has the potential to be associated with any (or every) other experience in a trader's life where he's been wrong. The implication is that any trade can easily tap him into the accumulated pain of every time he has been wrong in his life. Given the huge backlog of unresolved, negative energy surrounding what it means to be wrong that exists in most people, it's easy to see why each and every trade can literally take on the significance of a life or death situation.

Any part of our bodies coming into contact with a solid object with some degree of force will cause anyone with a normal nervous system to experience pain. We share the experience because our bodies are constructed in basically the same way. The pain is an automatic physiological response to the impact with a tangible object. Information in the form of words or gestures expressed by the environment, or up and down tics expressed by the market, can be just as painful as being hit with a solid object; but there's an important difference between information and objects. Information is not tangible. Information doesn't consist of atoms and molecules. To experience the potential effects of information, whether negative or positive, requires an interpretation. The interpretations we make are functions of our unique mental frameworks. Everyone's mental framework is unique for two fundamental reasons. First, all of us were born with different genetically encoded behavior and personality characteristics that cause us to have different needs from one another.

each individual will define, interpret, and consequently experience whatever information he is exposed to in his own unique way. There's no standardized way to experience what the environment may be offering—whether it's positive, neutral, or negative information—simply because there is no standardized mental framework in which to perceive information. Consider that, as traders, the market offers us something to perceive at each moment. In a sense, you could say that the market is communicating with us. If we start out with the premise that the market does not generate negatively charged information as an inherent characteristic of the way it exists, we can then ask, and answer, the question, "What causes information to take on a negative quality?" In other words, where exactly does the threat of pain come from? If it's not coming from the market, then it has to be coming from the way we define and interpret the available information. Defining and interpreting information is a function of what we assume we know or what we believe to be true. If what we know or believe is in fact true—and we wouldn't believe it if it weren't—then when we project our beliefs out into some future moment as an expectation, we naturally expect to be right.

We need to be rigid in our rules so that we gain a sense of self-trust that can, and will always, protect us in an environment that has few, if any, boundaries. We need to be flexible in our expectations so we can perceive, with the greatest degree of clarity and objectivity, what the market is communicating to us from its perspective. At this point, it probably goes without saying that the typical trader does just the opposite: He is flexible in his rules and rigid in his expectations.

There is a random distribution between wins and losses for any given set of variables that define an edge. 4. An edge is nothing more than an indication of a higher probability of one thing happening over another. 5. Eveiy moment in the market is unique.

the up and down tics themselves have no capacity to cause us to enter into any particular state of mind (negative or positive), lose our objectivity, make errors, or take us out of the opportunity flow. If it's not the market that causes us to experience a negatively charged state of mind, then what does cause it? The way we define and interpret the information we perceive. If that's the case, then what determines what we perceive and how we define and interpret that information? What we believe or what we assume to be true. Our beliefs working in conjunction with the association and painavoidance mechanisms act as a force on our five senses, causing us to perceive, define, and interpret market information in a way that is consistent with what we expect.

the instant we think we "know" what to expect, we simultaneously stop taking all the unknown forces and die various possibilities created by those forces into consideration. The unknown forces are other traders waiting to enter or exit trades, based on their beliefs about the future. In other words, we really can't know exactly what to expect from the market, until we can read the minds of all the traders who have the potential to act as a force on price movement. Not a very likely possibility. As traders, we can't afford to indulge ourselves in any form of "I know what to expect from the market." We can "know" exactly what an edge looks, sounds, or feels like, and we can "know" exactly how much we need to risk to find out if that edge is going to work.

Making money consistently is a by-product of acquiring and mastering certain mental skills.

Gathering "other" evidence makes about as much sense as trying to determine whether the next flip of a coin will be heads, after the last ten flips came up tails. Regardless of what evidence you find to support heads coming up, there is still a 50-percent chance that the next flip will come up tails. By the same token, regardless of how much evidence you gather to support acting or not acting on a trade, it still only takes one trader somewhere in the world to negate the validity of any, if not all, of your evidence. The point is why bother! If the market is offering you a legitimate edge, determine the risk and take the trade.

To take this example a little further, imagine what would happen to this person's state of mind if it occurred to him that he could have asked for more money. He is in a state of pure elation. However, the moment the thought either pops into his mind or someone he relates his story to offers the idea that he could have asked for a lot more money, his state of mind will immediately shift to a negatively charged state of regret or despair. Why? He tapped into a negatively charged belief about what it means to miss out on something or not get enough. As a result, instead of being happy over what he got, he will lament what he could have had but didn't get.

"What is the truth?" The answer is, whatever works. If beliefs impose limitations on what we perceive as possible, and the environment can express itself in an infinite combination of ways, then beliefs can only be true relative to what we are attempting to accomplish at any given moment.

At any given moment, if we find ourselves in a state of satisfaction, happiness, or well-being in relation to whatever we are attempting to accomplish, we can say that our truth (meaning whatever beliefs we are operating from) are useful because the process, as stated above, worked. What we perceived was not only consistent with our objective, it was also consistent with what was available from the environment's perspective. Our interpretation of the information we perceived resulted in a decision, expectation, and action that were in harmony with the environmental situation and circumstance. There was no resistance or counteracting force offered by the environment (or in our own mind) that would diminish the outcome we were trying to achieve. As a result, we find ourselves in a state of satisfaction, happiness, and well-being. On the other hand, if we find ourselves in a state of dissatisfaction, disappointment, frustration, confusion, despair, regret, or hopelessness, we can say that relative to the environmental situation and circumstances, the beliefs we are operating from don't work well or at all, and therefore are not useful. Simply put, the truth is a function of whatever works in relation to what we are trying to accomplish at any given moment.

There has to be something behind our relentless attempt to convince others of the validity of our beliefs and to deny the validity of theirs. Consider that every conflict, from the smallest to the largest, from the least to the most significant, whether between individuals, cultures, societies, or nations, is always the result of conflicting beliefs.

According to Albert Einstein and others in the scientific community, energy can neither be created nor destroyed; it can only be transformed. If beliefs are energy—structured, conscious energy that is aware of its existence—then this same principle of physics can be applied to beliefs, meaning, if we tiy to eradicate them, it's not going to work. If you knew someone or something was trying to destroy you, how would you respond? You would defend yourself, fight back, and possibly become even stronger than you were before you knew of the threat. Each individual belief is a component of what we consider to be our identity. Isn't it reasonable to expect that, if threatened, each individual belief would respond in a way that was consistent with how all the parts respond collectively? The same principle holds true if we tiy to act as if a particularly troublesome belief doesn't exist. If you woke up one morning and everyone you knew ignored you and acted as if you didn't exist, how would you respond? It probably wouldn't be long before you grabbed someone and got right in their face to try to force them to acknowledge you. Again, if purposely ignored, each individual belief will act in the very same way. It will find a way to force its presence into our conscious thought process or behavior. The easiest and most effective way to work with our beliefs is to gently render them inactive or nonfunctional by drawing the energy out of them. I call this process de-activation.

After de-activation, the original structure of the belief remains intact, so technically it hasn't changed. The difference is that the belief no longer has any energy. Without energy, it doesn't have the potential to act as a force on our perception of information or on our behavior.

2. All active beliefs demand expression. Beliefs fall into two basic categories: active and inactive. The distinction between the two is simple. Active beliefs are energized; they have enough energy to act as a force on our perception of information and on our behavior. An inactive belief is just the opposite. It is a belief, that for any number of reasons, no longer has energy, or has so little energy that it's no longer able to act as a force on how we perceive information or how we express ourselves.

As soon as you are out of the situation, you will probably find a way to "unload," or even spew out your side of the argument. You will probably describe what you had to endure to anyone you think will lend a sympathetic ear. This is an example of how our beliefs demand to be expressed when they are in conflict with the external environment. But what happens when one or more of our beliefs are in conflict with our intents, goals, dreams, wants, or desires? The implications of such a conflict can have a profound effect on our trading. As we have already learned, beliefs create distinctions in how the external environment can express itself. Distinctions, by definition, are boundaries.

There are two forces within the boy that are in direct conflict with each other, competing for expression: his belief that "all dogs are dangerous" and his desire to have fun and be like the other children. What he will do the next time he encounters a dog will be determined by which has more energy: his belief or his desire. Given the intensity of the energy in his belief that "All dogs are dangerous," we can reasonably assume that his belief will have far more energy than his desire. If that's the case, then he will find his next encounter with a dog very frustrating. Even though he may want to touch or pet the dog, he'll find that he can't interact with it in any way. The word "all" in his belief will act as a paralyzing force, preventing him from fulfilling his desire.

He might be well aware of the fact that the dog he wants to pet is not dangerous and won't hurt him; but he won't be able to pet it until the balance of energy tips in favor of his desire. If the boy genuinely wants to interact with dogs, he will have to overcome his fear. This means that he will have to de-activate his belief that all dogs are dangerous so he can properly install a belief about dogs that is more consistent with his desire.

However, the larger issue is, how can the boy de-activate the "all" in the belief that "All dogs are dangerous" so he can overcome his fear? Remember that all beliefs naturally resist any force that would alter their present form, but, as I indicated above, the appropriate approach is not to try to alter the belief, but rather to draw the energy out of it and channel that energy into another belief that is better suited to our purposes. To de-activate the concept the word "all" represents, the boy will have to create a positively charged experience with a dog; at some point, he will have to step through his fear and touch one.

From an energy dynamics perspective, he will be able to touch a dog when his desire to do so is at least one degree greater in intensity than his belief that all dogs are dangerous. The moment he actually does touch a dog, it will have the effect of drawing most of the remaining negative energy out of the "all" concept and transfer it to a belief that reflects his new experience.

Let's say you have a firm grasp of the nature of probabilities and, as a result, you "know" that the next trade is simply another trade in a series of trades that has a probable outcome. Yet you find you're still afraid to put that next trade on, or you're still susceptible to several of the fear-based trading errors we've discussed in previous chapters. Remember that the underlying cause of fear is the potential to define and interpret market information as threatening. What is the source of our potential to interpret market information as threatening? Our expectations! When the market generates information that doesn't conform to what we expect, the up and down tics seem to take on a threatening quality (become negatively charged). Consequently, we experience fear, stress, and anxiety. What is the underlying source of our expectations? Our beliefs. In light of what you now understand about the nature of beliefs, if you are still experiencing negative states of mind when you trade, you can assume there's a conflict between what you "know" about probable outcomes and any number of other beliefs in your mental environment that are arguing (demanding expression) for something else.

It really can't work any other way. A unique outcome is not something we have already experienced, therefore it is not something we can already know. If it were known, it could not be defined as unique.

Every time these traders hit the barrier, they experienced a significant draw down, regardless of the market conditions. However, when asked about what happened, they typically blamed their sudden run of bad luck on just that—luck or the vagaries of the market. Interestingly, they typically created a steadily rising equity curve, sometimes over a period of several months, and the significant draw down always occurred at the same spot in their equity curve. I describe this psychological phenomenon as being in a "negative zone." As magically as money can flow into a trader's accounts when he is "in the zone," it can just as easily flow out, if he is in a negative zone where unresolved self-valuation issues mysteriously act on his perception of information and behavior. I am not implying here that you have to de-activate every belief that would argue against your ever-expanding positive sense of selfvaluation, because you don't. But you must be aware of the presence of such beliefs, and take specific steps in your trading regimen to compensate when they start expressing themselves.

I'm sure you are familiar with the saying, "Make up your mind." The implication of "making up our minds" is that we decide exactly what we desire with so much clarity (absolutely no lingering doubts) and with so much conviction that literally nothing stands in our way, either internally or externally. If there's enough force behind our resolve, it's possible to experience a major shift in our mental structure virtually instantaneously.

De-activating internal conflicts is not a function of time; it's a function-focused desire (although it can take a considerable amount of time to get to the point where we really make up our minds). Otherwise, in the absence of extreme clarity and conviction, the technique of self-discipline, over time, will do the job quite nicely (if, of course, you're willing to use it). To get there, you must "make up your mind," with as much conviction and clarity as possible, that more than anything else you desire consistency (the state of mind of trust, confidence, and objectivity) from your trading.

The difference a tiny improvement can make over time is astounding. Here’s how the math works out: if you can get 1 percent better each day for one year, you’ll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you’re done.12 Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day for one year, you’ll decline nearly down to zero.

But when we repeat 1 percent errors, day after day, by replicating poor decisions, duplicating tiny mistakes, and rationalizing little excuses, our small choices compound into toxic results. It’s the accumulation of many missteps—a 1 percent decline here and there—that eventually leads to a problem. The impact created by a change in your habits is similar to the effect of shifting the route of an airplane by just a few degrees. Imagine you are flying from Los Angeles to New York City.

Ever so slowly, the room begins to heat up. Twenty-six degrees. Twenty-seven. Twenty-eight. The ice cube is still sitting on the table in front of you. Twenty-nine degrees. Thirty. Thirty-one. Still, nothing has happened. Then, thirty-two degrees. The ice begins to melt. A one-degree shift, seemingly no different from the temperature increases before it, has unlocked a huge change. Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change.

Similarly, habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance. In the early and middle stages of any quest, there is often a Valley of Disappointment. You expect to make progress in a linear fashion and it’s frustrating how ineffective changes can seem during the first days, weeks, and even months. It doesn’t feel like you are going anywhere. It’s a hallmark of any compounding process: the most powerful outcomes are delayed.

I began to realize that my results had very little to do with the goals I set and nearly everything to do with the systems I followed. What’s the difference between systems and goals? It’s a distinction I first learned from Scott Adams, the cartoonist behind the Dilbert comic. Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.

When scientists analyze people who appear to have tremendous self-control, it turns out those individuals aren’t all that different from those who are struggling. Instead, “disciplined” people are better at structuring their lives in a way that does not require heroic willpower and self-control. In other words, they spend less time in tempting situations.5

When scientists analyze people who appear to have tremendous self-control, it turns out those individuals aren’t all that different from those who are struggling. Instead, “disciplined” people are better at structuring their lives in a way that does not require heroic willpower and self-control. In other words, they spend less time in tempting situations.5 The people with the best self-control are typically the ones who need to use it the least. It’s easier to practice self-restraint when you don’t have to use it very often.6 So, yes, perseverance, grit, and willpower are essential to success, but the way to improve these qualities is not by wishing you were a more disciplined person, but by creating a more disciplined environment. This counterintuitive idea makes even more sense once you understand what happens when a habit is formed in the brain. A habit that has been encoded in the mind is ready to be used whenever the relevant situation arises.

Bad habits are autocatalytic: the process feeds itself. They foster the feelings they try to numb. You feel bad, so you eat junk food. Because you eat junk food, you feel bad. Watching television makes you feel sluggish, so you watch more television because you don’t have the energy to do anything else. Worrying about your health makes you feel anxious, which causes you to smoke to ease your anxiety, which makes your health even worse and soon you’re feeling more anxious. It’s a downward spiral, a runaway train of bad habits.

THE DOPAMINE-DRIVEN FEEDBACK LOOP Scientists can track the precise moment a craving occurs by measuring a neurotransmitter called dopamine.fn1 The importance of dopamine became apparent in 1954 when the neuroscientists James Olds and Peter Milner ran an experiment that revealed the neurological processes behind craving and desire.8, 9 By implanting electrodes in the brains of rats, the researchers blocked the release of dopamine. To the surprise of the scientists, the rats lost all will to live.10 They wouldn’t eat. They wouldn’t have sex. They didn’t crave anything. Within a few days, the animals died of thirst. In follow-up studies, other scientists also inhibited the dopamine-releasing parts of the brain, but this time, they squirted little droplets of sugar into the mouths of the dopamine-depleted rats. Their little rat faces lit up with pleasurable grins from the tasty substance. Even though dopamine was blocked, they liked the sugar just as much as before; they just didn’t want it anymore. The ability to experience pleasure remained, but without dopamine, desire died. And without desire, action stopped.11

Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop.14 Every behavior that is highly habit-forming—taking drugs, eating junk food, playing video games, browsing social media—is associated with higher levels of dopamine. The same can be said for our most basic habitual behaviors like eating food, drinking water, having sex, and interacting socially.

When it comes to habits, the key takeaway is this: dopamine is released not only when you experience pleasure, but also when you anticipate it.16 Gambling addicts have a dopamine spike right before they place a bet, not after they win. Cocaine addicts get a surge of dopamine when they see the powder, not after they take it. Whenever you predict that an opportunity will be rewarding, your levels of dopamine spike in anticipation. And whenever dopamine rises, so does your motivation to act.17 It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action.

For instance, researchers have found that 100 percent of the nucleus accumbens is activated during wanting.19 Meanwhile, only 10 percent of the structure is activated during liking. The fact that the brain allocates so much precious space to the regions responsible for craving and desire provides further evidence of the crucial role these processes play. Desire is the engine that drives behavior. Every action is taken because of the anticipation that precedes it. It is the craving that leads to the response.

■ The 2nd Law of Behavior Change is make it attractive. ■ The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming. ■ Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. When dopamine rises, so does our motivation to act. ■ It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action. The greater the anticipation, the greater the dopamine spike. ■ Temptation bundling is one way to make your habits more attractive. The strategy is to pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do.

Whenever we are unsure how to act, we look to the group to guide our behavior. We are constantly scanning our environment and wondering, “What is everyone else doing?” We check reviews on Amazon or Yelp or TripAdvisor because we want to imitate the “best” buying, eating, and travel habits. It’s usually a smart strategy. There is evidence in numbers. But there can be a downside. The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the individual.

Mike had been smoke-free for a few years at that point, and he swore up and down that he broke the habit because of a book called Allen Carr’s Easy Way to Stop Smoking. “It frees you from the mental burden of smoking,” he said. “It tells you: ‘Stop lying to yourself. You know you don’t actually want to smoke. You know you don’t really enjoy this.’ It helps you feel like you’re not the victim anymore. You start to realize that you don’t need to smoke.”

A craving is just a specific manifestation of a deeper underlying motive. Your brain did not evolve with a desire to smoke cigarettes or to check Instagram or to play video games. At a deep level, you simply want to reduce uncertainty and relieve anxiety, to win social acceptance and approval, or to achieve status. Look at nearly any product that is habit-forming and you’ll see that it does not create a new motivation, but rather latches onto the underlying motives of human nature. ■ Find love and reproduce = using Tinder ■ Connect and bond with others = browsing Facebook ■ Win social acceptance and approval = posting on Instagram ■ Reduce uncertainty = searching on Google ■ Achieve status and prestige = playing video games

Sometimes, all you need is a slight mind-set shift. For instance, we often talk about everything we have to do in a given day. You have to wake up early for work. You have to make another sales call for your business. You have to cook dinner for your family. Now, imagine changing just one word: You don’t “have” to. You “get” to.4 You get to wake up early for work. You get to make another sales call for your business. You get to cook dinner for your family.

Reframing your habits to highlight their benefits rather than their drawbacks is a fast and lightweight way to reprogram your mind and make a habit seem more attractive. Exercise. Many people associate exercise with being a challenging task that drains energy and wears you down. You can just as easily view it as a way to develop skills and build you up. Instead of telling yourself “I need to go run in the morning,” say “It’s time to build endurance and get fast.”6 Finance. Saving money is often associated with sacrifice. However, you can associate it with freedom rather than limitation if you realize one simple truth: living below your current means increases your future means. The money you save this month increases your purchasing power next month. Meditation. Anyone who has tried meditation for more than three seconds knows how frustrating it can be when the next distraction inevitably pops into your mind. You can transform frustration into delight when you realize that each interruption gives you a chance to practice returning to your breath. Distraction is a good thing because you need distractions to practice meditation. Pregame jitters. Many people feel anxious before delivering a big presentation or competing in an important event. They experience quicker breathing, a faster heart rate, heightened arousal. If we interpret these feelings negatively, then we feel threatened and tense up. If we interpret these feelings positively, then we can respond with fluidity and grace. You can reframe “I am nervous” to “I am excited and I’m getting an adrenaline rush to help me concentrate.”7

If there was anyone at the Clason-Hill Trust Corporation who was a go-getter, it was Joe. He worked hard, worked fast, and was headed for the top. At least, that was his plan. Joe was an ambitious young man, aiming for the stars. Still, sometimes it felt as if the harder and faster he worked, the further away his goals appeared. For such a dedicated go-getter, it seemed like he was doing a lot of going but not a lot of getting.

You can’t go in two directions at once. Trying to be successful with making money as your goal is like trying to travel a superhighway at seventy miles an hour with your eyes glued to the rearview mirror.” He took another thoughtful sip and waited for Joe to process this thought.

You’ve heard the expression ‘Go looking for trouble and that’s what you’ll find’?” Joe nodded. “It’s true, and not only about trouble. It’s true about everything. Go looking for conflict, and you’ll find it. Go looking for people to take advantage of you, and they generally will. See the world as a dog-eat-dog place, and you’ll always find a bigger dog looking at you as if you’re his next meal. Go looking for the best in people, and you’ll be amazed at how much talent, ingenuity, empathy and goodwill you’ll find. “Ultimately, the world treats you more or less the way you expect to be treated.”

Joe drew a breath. “So,” he spoke this next thought slowly, thinking it through out loud, “you’re saying, people don’t take advantage of you because you don’t expect them to? That because you don’t put any focus on selfishness and greed, even when it’s all around you, it doesn’t have much impact on you?” Then he had a flash of inspiration. “Like a healthy immune system—the disease is all around you, but you don’t catch it?” Pindar’s eyes sparkled. “Wonderful! That’s an exquisite way of putting it.” He kept talking as he scribbled in a little notebook he had produced from inside his jacket. “I have to remember that. You mind if I use that bit of brilliance?”

But if you don’t abide by my Condition, our meetings will come to an end.” “But,” Joe stammered, “not to sound impertinent, how would you know?” “Another excellent question. How would I know?” Pindar nodded thoughtfully. “I wouldn’t. But you would. It’s the honor system. If you don’t find a way to apply each Law I show you the very same day you learn it, I’ll trust that the next morning, you’ll call Brenda to cancel the rest of our appointments.” He looked at Joe.

Fair enough.” Pindar smiled. “Joe, no offense, but you don’t have that power.”

“It never hurts to be kind to people,” Pindar replied. “Once when I was a young man, I was walking to a young lady’s home to meet her for our very first date. I was nervous. As I turned onto her street, an older man walked right into me, banging his head into mine and tromping on my foot. He was embarrassed that he hadn’t been watching where he was going and mortified that he might have injured me. ‘No harm done,’ I assured him. ‘I’ve been told I have a hard head—I hope you didn’t hurt yourself!’ He laughed with surprise. I wished him a wonderful day and hurried on to meet my young lady friend. “About fifteen minutes after I’d arrived at the girl’s home, I heard the front door open. ‘Daddy!’ she called out, ‘I want you to meet my date.’ ” Pindar stopped and glanced at Joe as if expecting him to finish the story. Joe did. “And let me guess—it was the man who had smacked into you?” “It was,” agreed Pindar, “back from a quick trip to the store. He complimented his daughter on her good judgment and told her I was a thoughtful, polite young man.”

And many of those great fortunes have been squandered by others who had a greater passion for what they were getting than what they were giving.”

Some of these tasks she enjoyed more than others. However, she approached each one as though she loved it. She did this by reminding herself that, regardless of how much or how little she cared for the task itself, she relished the opportunity to survive, save and serve. “Survive, save and serve?” Joe interrupted. “Sounds like a motto.” “It easily could be,” agreed Pindar. “They are the three universal reasons for working.

My own research quest has focused on the question, “What makes a great company tick—why do some companies make the leap from good to great (while others don’t), why do some become built to last (while others fall), and why do some thrive in chaos?” One of our key findings is the idea of “Preserve the Core/Stimulate Progress”; no enterprise can become or remain truly great without a core set of principles to preserve, to build upon, to serve as an anchor, to provide guidance in the face of an ever-changing world.

Gates understood that Microsoft would need to complement its strengths with the strengths of others: Intel with its microprocessors, and personal computer manufacturers such as IBM and Dell. He also shared equity, so that when Microsoft won, Microsoft people would win as well. And he displayed a remarkable ability to complement his personal strengths with the strengths of others, especially his longtime business alter ego, Steve Ballmer; Gates and Ballmer accomplished much more by working together than they ever could alone; 1 + 1 is much larger than 2 (Habit 6: Synergize).

One of the most important variables in whether an enterprise remains great lies in a simple question: what is the truth about the inner motivations, character, and ambition of those who hold power? Their true, internal motivations will absolutely show up in their decisions and actions—if not immediately, then over time, and certainly under duress—no matter what they say or how they pose. And thus, we return full circle to a central tenet of Covey’s framework: build inner character first—private victory before public victory.

Many traders only get to the point of self-coaching after they have experienced harrowing losses. The reason is similar to my experience with my diagnosis: it was the vivid fear of consequences—the intense feeling of not wanting to ruin my life—that drove my dietary change. Similarly, after traders lost a good deal of their capital, they never want to experience that again. They trade well, not because they talk themselves into discipline, but because they feel the emotional force of discipline’s absence.

To each of your goals, add an or else scenario. Vividly imagine the consequences of not sustaining your change. Relive in detail specific failure experiences that resulted from the faulty behavior you want to change. When you add an or else condition to your goal setting, you turn fear into motivation. The brain is wired to respond first and foremost to danger; you will not gravitate toward the wrong behaviors if you’re emotionally connected to their danger. To this day, my diet is firmly in place. Fear has become my friend.

One way I do that when I coach others (and when I work on my own trading) is to ask traders to identify what they did best in yesterday’s trading that they want to continue today. Set a positive goal, based on strengths, to keep you in touch with the best within you.Itaffirms your competencies and keeps these visible, even during challenging market times. Too many of our goals are negative: we declare that we won’t do X or that we’ll do less of Y. Instead, frame a goal for today that says: “Here is what I’m good at, here’s what I did best yesterday, and here’s how I’m going to make use of that strength today.”

while you stay seated, focused, and breathing rhythmically and deeply. You evoke one concern at a time (for example, thoughts or fears about your recent profitability) and then dismiss the thoughts and bring yourself back to the music. Instead of having the thoughts intrude on you unexpectedly, you intentionally call them to mind and practice and then put them away, as you stay calm and focused. You might even guide yourself through imagery as you’re breathing deeply and slowly, imagining your negative thoughts as trash that you decide to put in a garbage pail. Instead of avoiding your negative thoughts, bring them to mind as your own, inner trash-talking—and then visualize yourself taking out the garbage.

Do this every day for a few minutes and you can train yourself to gain control over negative thought patterns. Most importantly, you develop the capacity to become an observer to those thoughts, rather than to identify with them. If you can observe something about yourself, you immediately introduce an element of psychological distance.

By enacting a new role, he experienced himself in a new manner—and this infiltrated a variety of areas of his life. Here’s another example: For years I tended to be impatient—with myself, with others, with trading, and even with the pace of change among people I met in therapy. When Margie and I had two children, however, I found myself in a new role that did not allow me to be impatient if I were going to be a good parent. Because it was clear that both our children had personalities very different from mine, I had to figure out ways to communicate with them on their terms. The new role as a patient parent provided me with a discrepant set of experiences; I subsequently found myself more patient in a variety of situations, whether it was behind the wheel of a car or during counseling work with a client who felt stuck. The new role generated novel, positive scripts. With the favorable mirroring over years of parenting, I’ve actually changed how I see myself. I now experience myself as a relatively calm, patient person: it has become an integral part of my identity.

1. Timing and Readiness. Timing is everything, in psychology as in trading. The research of Prochaska and DiClemente suggests that people are most likely to make changes when they’re ready to make changes. Many times we’re conflicted about change; we’re not really sure that we want to abandon old ways. I talked with a trader recently who lost much more money than he should have (and than his plan called for) because he simultaneously traded three positions with full size when those positions were highly correlated. He was wrong and he blew out. But when we reviewed the unit sizing by trade idea rather than simply by position, it was clear that he wasn’t sure he wanted to make smaller bets. He was upset because he was wrong on the idea, not because he had violated risk-management discipline. My job was then to help him become more ready for the change he needed to make, just as an alcohol counselor must help an alcoholic become more ready to commit to sobriety. You will change when you’re ready to change, and you’ll be ready to change when you recognize that you need to change.

The best traders, I find, are those who have made self-improvement a way of life. Such traders are driven in their work lives, their physical fitness, and their recreations. They derive great meaning and satisfaction from being the best they can be. The same is true of great athletes: they love working out; they constantly challenge themselves. It’s when change is a lifestyle that we see exemplary performance. At that point, self-coaching becomes a life philosophy—an organizing principle—not just a discrete activity among many during the day or week.

When I was an undergraduate at Duke University, David Aderman and I performed an experiment. We had two groups of subjects deliver a speech. Both groups received negative feedback about their performance. The first group was told that speaking ability was linked to personality and could not be changed. The second group was told that they could improve their speaking skills relatively easily. At the end of the session, the first group reported significantly more distress than the second group. It wasn’t getting the negative feedback that generated distress; it was the perception that they were not competent to change the negative situation.

People who think this way have belief confused with wishful thinking. And true enough, you can’t wish away a mountain. You can’t wish yourself into an executive suite. Nor can you wish yourself into a five-bedroom, three-bath house or the high-income brackets. You can’t wish yourself into a position of leadership. But you can move a mountain with belief. You can win success by believing you can succeed.

There is nothing magical or mystical about the power of belief. Belief works this way. Belief, the “I’m-positive-I-can” attitude, generates the power, skill, and energy needed to do. When you believe I-can-do-it, the how-to-do-it develops.

Look at it this way. Belief is the thermostat that regulates what we accomplish in life. Study the fellow who is shuffling down there in mediocrity. He believes he is worth little, so he receives little. He believes he can’t do big things, and he doesn’t. He believes he is unimportant, so everything he does has an unimportant mark. As times goes by, lack of belief in himself shows through in the way the fellow talks, walks, acts. Unless he readjusts his thermostat forward, he shrinks, grows smaller and smaller, in his own estimation. And, since others see in us what we see in ourselves, he grows smaller in the estimation of the people around him. Now look across the way at the person who is advancing forward. He believes he is worth much, and he receives much. He believes he can handle big, difficult assignments–and he does. Everything he does, the way he handles himself with people, his character, his thoughts, his viewpoints, all say, “Here is a professional. He is an important person.”

Then it dawned on me that no one else was going to believe in me until I believed in myself. “Right then I decided, ‘I’m through feeling second-class. From here on in I’m not going to sell myself short.’ “Next morning I still had that confidence. During the job interview I gave my newfound confidence its first test. Before coming for the interview I’d hoped I would have courage to ask for $750 or maybe even $1,000 more than my present job was paying. But now, after realizing I was a valuable man, I upped it to $3,500. And I got it. I sold myself because after that one long night of self-analysis I found things in myself that made me a lot more saleable. “Within two years after I took that job I had established a reputation as the fellow who can get business. Then we went into a recession. This made me still more valuable because I was one of the best business-getters in the industry. The company was reorganized and I was given a substantial amount of stock plus a lot more pay.” Believe in yourself, and good things do start happening.

HOW TO DEVELOP THE POWER OF BELIEF Here are the three guides to acquiring and strengthening the power of belief: 1. Think success, don’t think failure. At work, in your home, substitute success thinking for failure thinking. When you face a difficult situation, think, “I’ll win,” not “I’ll probably lose.” When you compete with someone else, think, “I’m equal to the best,” not “I’m outclassed.” When opportunity appears, think “I can do it,” never “I can’t.” Let the master thought “I will succeed” dominate your thinking process. Thinking success conditions your mind to create plans that produce success. Thinking failure does the exact opposite. Failure thinking conditions the mind to think other thoughts that produce failure. 2. Remind yourself regularly that you are better than you think you are. Successful people are not supermen. Success does not require a superintellect. Nor is there anything mystical about success. And success isn’t based on luck. Successful people are just ordinary folks who have developed belief in themselves and what they do. Never—yes, never—sell yourself short. 3. Believe Big. The size of your success is determined by the size of your belief. Think little goals and expect little achievements. Think big goals and win big success. Remember this, too! Big ideas and big plans are often easier—certainly no more difficult—than small ideas and small plans.

To be sure, it is thrilling to watch what can happen when men cooperate carefully with nature. But it is not one-tenth as fascinating as watching yourself respond to your own carefully administered thought management program. It’s fun to feel yourself growing more confident, more effective, more successful day by day, month by month. Nothing—absolutely nothing—in this life gives you more satisfaction than knowing you’re on the road to success and achievement. And nothing stands as a bigger challenge than making the most of yourself.

Study the lives of successful people and you’ll discover this: all the excuses made by the mediocre fellow could be but aren’t made by the successful person. I have never met nor heard of a highly successful business executive, military officer, salesman, professional person, or leader in any field who could not have found one or more major excuses to hide behind. Roosevelt could have hidden behind his lifeless legs; Truman could have used “no college education”; Kennedy could have said, “I’m too young to be president”; Johnson and Eisenhower could have ducked behind heart attacks.

“Third, I’d resolve to live until I die.” I went on to explain to this troubled fellow some sound advice I received many years ago from a lawyer friend who had an arrested case of tuberculosis. This friend knew he would have to live a regulated life but this hasn’t stopped him from practicing law, rearing a fine family, and really enjoying life. My friend, who now is seventy-eight years old, expresses his philosophy in these words: “I’m going to live until I die and I’m not going to get life and death confused. While I’m on this earth I’m going to live. Why be only half alive? Every minute a person spends worrying about dying is just one minute that fellow might as well have been dead.”

FOUR THINGS YOU CAN DO TO KICK HEALTH EXCUSITIS The best vaccine against health excusitis consists of these four doses: 1. Refuse to talk about your health. The more you talk about an ailment, even the common cold, the worse it seems to get. Talking about bad health is like putting fertilizer on weeds. Besides, talking about your health is a bad habit. It bores people. It makes one appear self-centered and old-maidish. Success-minded people defeat the natural tendency to talk about their “bad” health. One may (and let me emphasize the word may) get a little sympathy, but one doesn’t get respect and loyalty by being a chronic complainer. 2. Refuse to worry about your health. Dr. Walter Alvarez, emeritus consultant to the world-famous Mayo Clinic, wrote, “I always beg worriers to exercise some self-control. For instance, when I saw this man (a fellow who was convinced he had a diseased gallbladder although eight separate X-ray examinations showed that the organ was perfectly normal), I begged him to quit getting his gallbladder X-rayed. I have begged hundreds of heart-conscious men to quit getting electrocardiograms made.” 3. Be genuinely grateful that your health is as good as it is. There’s an old saying worth repeating often: “I felt sorry for myself because I had ragged shoes until I met a man who had no feet.” Instead of complaining about “not feeling good,” it’s far better to be glad you are as healthy as you are. Just being grateful for the health you have is powerful vaccination against developing new aches and pains and real illness. 4. Remind yourself often, “It’s better to wear out than rust out.” Life is yours to enjoy. Don’t waste it. Don’t pass up living by thinking yourself into a hospital bed.

the thinking that guides your intelligence is much more important than how much intelligence you have. Not even a Ph.D. degree can override this basic success principle! Several years ago I became a close friend of Phil F., one of the senior officers of a major advertising agency. Phil was director of marketing research for the agency, and he was doing a bang-up job. Was Phil a “brain”? Far from it. Phil knew next to nothing about research technique. He knew next to nothing about statistics. He was not a college graduate (though all the people working for him were). And Phil did not pretend to know the technical side of research. What, then, enabled Phil to command $30,000 a year while not one of his subordinates earned $10,000?

Once I was retained by an insurance company to learn why the top 25 percent of the agents were selling over 75 percent of the insurance while the bottom 25 percent of the agents sold only 5 percent of total volume. Thousands of personnel files were carefully checked. The search proved beyond any question that no significant difference existed in native intelligence. What’s more, differences in education did not explain the difference in selling success. The difference in the very successful and the very unsuccessful finally reduced to differences in attitudes, or difference in thought management.

I talked with Cecil several times about his “old age” problem. I used the old medicine, “You’re only as old as you feel,” but I found I was getting nowhere.(Too often people retort with “But I do feel old!”) Finally, I discovered a method that worked. One day after a training session, I tried it on Cecil. I said, “Cecil, when does a man’s productive life begin?” He thought a couple of seconds and answered, “Oh, when he’s about twenty, I guess.” “Okay,” I said, “now, when does a man’s productive life end?” Cecil answered, “Well, if he stays in good shape and likes his work, I guess a man is still pretty useful when he’s seventy or so.” “All right,” I said, “a lot of folks are highly productive after they reach seventy, but let’s agree with what you’ve just said, a man’s productive years stretch from twenty to seventy. That’s fifty years in between, or half a century. Cecil,” I said, “you’re forty. How many years of productive life have you spent?” “Twenty,” he answered. “And how many have you left?” “Thirty” he replied. “In other words, Cecil, you haven’t even reached the halfway point; you’ve used up only 40 percent of your productive years.” I looked at Cecil and realized he’d gotten the point. He was cured of age excusitis. Cecil saw he still had many opportunity-filled years left. He switched from thinking “I’m already old” to “I’m still young.” Cecil now realized that how old we are is not important. It’s one’s attitude toward age that makes it a blessing or a barricade.

In quick recap, the cure for age excusitis is: 1. Look at your present age positively. Think, “I’m still young,” not “I’m already old.” Practice looking forward to new horizons and gain the enthusiasm and the feel of youth. 2. Compute how much productive time you have left. Remember, a person age thirty still has 80 percent of his productive life ahead of him. And the fifty-year-old still has a big 40 percent—the best 40 percent—of his opportunity years left. Life is actually longer than most people think! 3. Invest future time in doing what you really want to do. It’s too late only when you let your mind go negative and think it’s too late. Stop thinking “I should have started years ago.” That’s failure thinking. Instead think, “I’m going to start now, my best years are ahead of me.” That’s the way successful people think.

CONQUER LUCK EXCUSITIS IN TWO WAYS Accept the law of cause and effect. Take a second look at what appears to be someone’s “good luck.” You’ll find that not luck but preparation, planning, and success-producing thinking preceded his good fortune. Take a second look at what appears to be someone’s “bad luck.” Look, and you’ll discover certain specific reasons. Mr. Success receives a setback; he learns and profits. But when Mr. Mediocre loses, he fails to learn. Don’t be a wishful thinker. Don’t waste your mental muscles dreaming of an effortless way to win success. We don’t become successful simply through luck. Success comes from doing those things and mastering those principles that produce success. Don’t count on luck for promotions, victories, the good things in life. Luck simply isn’t designed to deliver these good things. Instead, just concentrate on developing those qualities in yourself that will make you a winner.

The old “it’s-only-in-your-mind” treatment presumes fear doesn’t really exist. But it does. Fear is real. Fear is success enemy number one. Fear stops people from capitalizing on opportunity; fear wears down physical vitality; fear actually makes people sick, causes organic difficulties, shortens life; fear closes your mouth when you want to speak. Fear—uncertainty, lack of confidence—explains why we still have economic recessions. Fear explains why millions of people accomplish little and enjoy little. Truly, fear is a powerful force. In one way or another fear prevents people from getting what they want from life.

1. Deposit only positive thoughts in your memory bank. Let’s face it squarely: everyone encounters plenty of unpleasant, embarrassing, and discouraging situations. But unsuccessful and successful people deal with these situations in directly opposite ways. Unsuccessful people take them to heart, so to speak. They dwell on the unpleasant situations, thereby giving them a good start in their memory. They don’t take their minds away from them. At night the unpleasant situation is the last thing they think about. Confident, successful people, on the other hand, “don’t give it another thought.” Successful people specialize in putting positive thoughts into their memory bank.

Whether the psychological problem is big or little, the cure comes when one learns to quit drawing negatives from one’s memory bank and withdraws positives instead. Don’t build mental monsters. Refuse to withdraw the unpleasant thoughts from your memory bank. When you remember situations of any kind, concentrate on the good part of the experience; forget the bad. Bury it. If you find yourself thinking about the negative side, turn your mind off completely.

And your confidence, that feeling of being on top of the world, will zoom upward. You take a big step forward toward conquering fear when you refuse to remember negative, self-deprecating thoughts.

Doing what’s right keeps your conscience satisfied. And this builds self-confidence. When we do what is known to be wrong, two negative things happen. First, we feel guilt and this guilt eats away confidence. Second, other people sooner or later find out and lose confidence in us. Do what’s right and keep your confidence. That’s thinking yourself to success. Here is a psychological principle that is worth reading over twenty-five times. Read it until it absolutely saturates you: To think confidently, act confidently.

Psychologists link slovenly posture and sluggish walking to unpleasant attitudes towards oneself, work, and the people around us. But psychologists also tell us you can actually change your attitudes by changing your posture and speed of movement. Watch, and you discover that body action is the result of mind action.

And a real smile does more than cure just your ill feeling. A real smile melts away the opposition of others—and instantly, too. Another person simply can’t be angry with you if you give him a big, sincere smile. Just the other day, a little incident happened to me that illustrates this. I was parked at an intersection waiting for the light to change when BAM! The driver behind me had let his foot slip the brake and put my rear bumper to a test. I looked back through my mirror and saw him getting out. I got out, too, and, forgetting the rule book, started preparing myself for verbal combat. I confess I was ready verbally to bite him to pieces. But fortunately, before I got the chance, he walked up to me, smiled, and said in the most earnest voice, “Friend, I really didn’t mean to do that.” That smile, matched with his sincere comment, melted me. I mumbled something about “That’s O.K. Happens all the time.” Almost in less time than it takes to wink an eye, my opposition turned into friendship.

Smile big and you feel like “happy days are here again.” But smile big. A half-developed smile is not fully guaranteed. Smile until your teeth show. That large-size smile is fully guaranteed. I’ve heard many times, “Yes, but when I fear something, or when I’m angry, I don’t feel like smiling.” Of course you don’t. No one does. The trick is to tell yourself forcefully, “I’m going to smile.” Then smile. Harness the power of smiling.

Make a supreme effort to put only positive thoughts in your memory bank. Don’t let negative, self-deprecatory thoughts grow into mental monsters. Simply refuse to recall unpleasant events or situations. Put people in proper perspective. Remember, people are more alike, much more alike, than they are different. Get a balanced view of the other fellow. He is just another human being. And develop an understanding attitude. Many people will bark, but it’s a rare one who bites. Practice doing what your conscience tells you is right. This prevents a poisonous guilt complex from developing. Doing what’s right is a very practical rule for success. Make everything about you say, “I’m confident, really confident.” Practice these little techniques in your day-to-day activities: Be a front seater. Make eye contact. Walk 25 percent faster.

Here is an exercise to help you measure your true size. I’ve used it in training programs for executives and sales personnel. It works. 1. Determine your five chief assets. Invite some objective friend to help—possibly your wife, your superior, a professor—some intelligent person who will give you an honest opinion. (Examples of assets frequently listed are education, experience, technical skills, appearance, well-adjusted home life, attitudes, personality, initiative.) 2. Next, under each asset, write the names of three persons you know who have achieved large success but who do not have this asset to as great a degree as you. When you’ve completed this exercise, you will find you outrank many successful people on at least one asset. There is only one conclusion you can honestly reach: You’re bigger than you think. So fit your thinking to your true size. Think as big as you really are! Never, never, never sell yourself short! The

PHRASES THAT CREATE SMALL, NEGATIVE MIND IMAGES PHRASES THAT CREATE BIG, POSITIVE MIND IMAGES It’s no use, we’re whipped. We’re not whipped yet. Let’s keep trying. Here’s a new angle. I was in that business once and failed. Never again. I went broke but it was my own fault. I’m going to try again. I’ve tried but the product won’t sell. People don’t want it. So far I’ve not been able to sell this product. But I know it is good and I’m going to find the formula that will put it over. The market is saturated. Imagine, 75 percent of the potential has already been sold. Better get out. Imagine, 25 percent of the market is still not sold. Count me in. This looks big! Their orders have been small. Cut them off. Their orders have been small. Let’s map out a plan for selling them more of their needs. Five years is too long a time to spend before I’ll get into the top ranks in your company. Count me out. Five years is not really a long time. Just think, that leaves me thirty years to serve at a high level. The competition has all the advantage. How do you expect me to sell against them? Competition is strong. There’s no denying that, but no one ever has all the advantages. Let’s put our heads together and figure out a way to beat them at their own game. Nobody will ever want that product. In its present form, it may not be saleable, but let’s consider some modifications. Let’s wait until a recession comes along, then buy stocks. Let’s invest now. Bet on prosperity not depression. I’m too young (old) for the job. Being young (old) is a distinct advantage. It won’t work, let me prove it. The image: dark, gloom, disappointment, grief, failure. It will work, let me prove it. The image: bright, hope, success, fun, victory.

Four Ways to Develop the Big Thinker’s Vocabulary Here are four ways to help you develop a big thinker’s vocabulary. 1. Use big, positive, cheerful words and phrases to describe how you feel. When someone asks, “How do you feel today?” and you respond with an “I’m tired (I have a headache, I wish it were Saturday, I don’t feel so good),” you actually make yourself feel worse. Practice this: it’s a very simple point, but it has tremendous power. Every time someone asks you, “How are you?” or “How are you feeling today?” respond with a “Just wonderful thanks, and you?” or say “Great” or “Fine.” Say you feel wonderful at every possible opportunity, and you will begin to feel wonderful—and bigger, too.

2. Use bright, cheerful, favorable words and phrases to describe other people. Make it a rule to have a big, positive word for all your friends and associates. When you and someone else are discussing an absent third party, be sure you compliment him with big words and phrases like “He’s really a fine fellow.” “They tell me he’s working out wonderfully well.” Be extremely careful to avoid the petty cut-him-down language. Sooner or later third parties hear what’s been said, and then such talk only cuts you down. 3. Use positive language to encourage others.

Ask yourself, “What can I do to ‘add value’ to this room or this house or this business?” Look for ideas to make things worth more. A thing—whether it be a vacant lot, a house, or a business—has value in proportion to the ideas for using it. 2. Practice adding value to people. As you move higher and higher in the world of success, more and more of your job becomes “people development.” Ask, “What can I do to ‘add value’ to my subordinates? What can I do to help them to become more effective?” Remember, to bring out the best in a person, you must first visualize his best. 3.

As you move higher and higher in the world of success, more and more of your job becomes “people development.” Ask, “What can I do to ‘add value’ to my subordinates? What can I do to help them to become more effective?” Remember, to bring out the best in a person, you must first visualize his best. 3. Practice adding value to yourself. Conduct a daily interview with yourself. Ask, “What can I do to make myself more valuable today?” Visualize yourself not as you are but as you can be. Then specific ways for attaining your potential value will suggest themselves. Just try and see.

Step one: Believe it can be done. Here is a basic truth: To do anything, we must first believe it can be done. Believing something can be done sets the mind in motion to find a way to do it. To illustrate this point of creative thinking in training sessions, I often use this example: I ask the group, “How many of you feel it is possible to eliminate jails within the next thirty years?” Invariably the group looks bewildered, not quite sure they heard right and thinking they are listening to a real oddball. So after a pause I repeat, “How many of you feel it is possible to eliminate jails within the next thirty years?” Once they’re sure I’m not joking, someone always blasts me with something like “You mean to say you want to turn all those murderers, thieves, and rapists loose? Don’t you realize what this would mean? Why, none of us would be safe. We have to have jails.” Then the others cut loose: “All order would break down if we didn’t have jails.” “Some people are born criminals.” “If anything, we need more jails.” “Did you read in this morning’s paper about that murder?” And the group goes on, telling me all sorts of good reasons why we must have jails. One fellow even suggested we’ve got to have jails so the police and prison guards can have jobs. After about ten minutes of letting the group “prove” why we can’t eliminate the need for jails, I say to them, “Now let me mention here that this question of eliminating jails is used to make a point. “Each of you has come up with reasons why we can’t eliminate the need for jails. Will you do me a favor? Will you try extra hard for a few minutes to believe we can eliminate jails?” Joining in the spirit of the experiment, the group says, in effect, “Oh, well, but just for kicks.” Then I ask, “Now, assuming we can eliminate jails, how could we begin?” Suggestions come slowly at first. Someone hesitantly says something like, “Well, you might cut down crime if you established more youth centers.” Before long, the group, which ten minutes ago was solidly against the idea, now begins to work up real enthusiasm. “Work to eliminate poverty. Most crime stems from the low income levels.” “Conduct research to spot  <You have reached the clipping limit for this item>

Do not dial down to a 1-minute chart and tighten your stop because you will lose. The problem with the 1-minute chart is that it tempts you by offering lots of entries. However, you will not be able to take them all and you will instead cherry-pick, which will lead to the death of your account; you will invariably pick too many bad cherries.

Also, since often the entry bar extreme is tested to the tick and the stops are not run, there must be institutional size volume protecting the stops, and they are doing so based on price action. In the 5-minute Emini, there are certain price action events that change the perspective of smart traders. For example, if a High 2 long pullback fails, smart traders will assume that the market will likely have two more legs down. If you are an institutional trader and you bought that High 2, you do not want it to fail, and you will buy more all the way down to one tick above that key protective stop price. That institution is using price action to support their long.

you should be trying to enter trades that have a good chance of running well past your profit target, and you should therefore only take partial profits. In fact, initially you should only focus on those entries. Move your stop to breakeven and then let the remainder run. You will likely have at least a couple of trades each week that run to four or more times your initial target before setting up a reverse entry pattern.

The 5-minute chart on the right of Figure 1.2 had four dojis in a row, starting at Bar 1, each With Trending closes, highs and lows. The 15-minute chart on the left of Figure 1.2 shows that they created a bull reversal bar at what was then a new swing low and a bear trend channel line overshoot (not drawn). Individual dojis mean that neither the bulls nor the bears are controlling the market, but trending dojis indicate a trend.

Just like dojis don’t always mean the market is trendless, a trend bar does not always mean that the market is trending. Bar 1 in Figure 1.3 is a strong bull trend bar that broke out of a line of dojis. However, there was no follow through. The next bar extended one tick above the trend bar and then closed on its low. The longs exited at one tick below this bear pause bar and new shorts sold there as well, viewing this as a failed bull breakout. No one was interested in buying without more bullish price action, and this caused the market to drop. The bulls tried to protect the low of the bull breakout bar by forming a small bull trend bar (Bar 2 was a setup for a Breakout Pullback long but it was never triggered),

At this point, after the bulls failed in two attempts, they would not be willing to buy without substantial price action in their favor, and both they and the bears would be looking for at least two legs down.

If the reversal bar is much smaller than the last several bars, especially if it has a small body, it lacks Countertrend strength and is a riskier signal bar. However, if the bar has a strong body and is in the right context, the risk of the trade is small (one tick beyond the other side of the small bar).

A big bull reversal bar with a small body also has to be considered in the context of the prior price action. The large lower tail indicates that the selling was rejected and the buyers controlled the bar. However, if the bar overlaps the prior bar or bars excessively, then it might just represent a trading range on a smaller time frame, and the close at the top of the bar might simply be a close near the top of the range, destined to be followed by more selling as the 1-minute bulls take profit.

When the market is in a trading range in a downswing, it is forming a bear flag. Smart traders will look to sell near the high, and they would only buy near the low if the setup was strong. As trite as the saying is, “Buy low, sell high” remains one of the best guiding principles for traders.

inside bar does not have to be totally inside (high below the prior bar’s high and a low above the prior bar’s low). One or both of its extremes can be identical to that of the prior bar. In general, it forms a more reliable signal when it is a small bar and when its close is in the direction of the trade you want to take (it is always better to have bull setup bars when you are looking to buy and bear bars when you are looking to sell).

In a trend (even one during a trading range day), a small bar can setup an entry in either direction. For example, if there is a strong bull move and no prior bull trendline break, an inside bar near the high of a large bull trend bar or a small bar that extends above the high of the trend bar should only be viewed as a buy setup. If it is an inside bar, especially if it is a bull trend bar, it is a great long setup.

When there is a strong bull, there will sometimes be two consecutive bars with identical highs, and usually with small tails at the tops of the two bars. This is a Double Top Twin buy setup and is a Double Top on the 1-minute chart. Place a stop to go long at one tick above the high of the bars because you will be buying a failed Double Top, and there will be protective stops there from traders who shorted it, adding fuel to the move. Likewise, in a strong bear, look to short on a stop at one tick below a Double Bottom Twin sell setup.

When a trend bar in a strong trend has a shaved body (no tail) at one or both ends, it indicates that the market is one-sided and strong. However, a shaved top on a 5-minute bull trend bar in a runaway bull is stronger than a shaved bottom, because the extreme strength is right into the close of the bar, and it is more likely to continue than strength that occurred five minutes earlier.

When a trend bar in a strong trend has a shaved body (no tail) at one or both ends, it indicates that the market is one-sided and strong. However, a shaved top on a 5-minute bull trend bar in a runaway bull is stronger than a shaved bottom, because the extreme strength is right into the close of the bar, and it is more likely to continue than strength that occurred five minutes earlier. Therefore, a shaved top is a good setup for a long, but it is often impossible to place a buy stop order because the next bar will already be above the high before you can place your order. If the bar has a one tick tail at its high or a shaved bottom, it is still strong, but in general, that alone would not be reason enough to buy above its high. Also, the bar has to be analyzed in context. If the bar is in a trading range, it would be foolish to buy above its high because trading ranges tend to test the extremes repeatedly, and you should not be buying near the high when the odds of the bar being a test are greater than the odds of the bar being a successful breakout.

Here’s an example of a Mental Hand History highlighting a fear of losing: What’s the problem: I have a need for a trade to be green right from the beginning. My heart rate jumps once I get into the trade, and it goes through the roof if it’s immediately in the red. When it’s moving in the wrong direction, I get nervous that it’s going to get stopped out. Why does the problem exist: Part of me thinks the first second of a trade represents what is going to happen in the trade. If it’s green, I relax, which is stupid, but really I just want it to hit. Every loss feels like a step backward—like it’s going to take me longer to hit my goals. What is flawed: I can’t control the outcome of every trade. If I make a good bet, that’s all I can control. I’m going to lose a lot. That doesn’t mean my goals are at risk. One trade tells me nothing about what the year is going to look like. That’s like judging the outcome of a baseball game on the first pitch. What’s the correction: Stay focused on quality execution. Once I’m in, go look at a snapshot of the trade, so I can evaluate the quality of it without being distracted by the chart. If I made a good bet, take the hit, and look for another opportunity. What logic confirms that correction: Quality execution in the short term is how I get what I want in the long run. Losses and drawdowns are part of the game—any game, for that matter. Champions don’t fear losing; they do everything they can to win.

It’s also worth noting that catastrophe can lead to innovation and adaptation. Take, for instance, the trader who bombs out and has to temporarily take a different job. In that job a new perspective emerges for the value of emotional stability, and discipline improves. When trading resumes, those improved skills become the catalyst for long-term success. No one predicts that their road to success will wind through disaster, but that may turn out to be what was needed.

To focus on technique is like cramming your way through school. You sometimes get by, perhaps even get good grades, but if you don’t pay the price day in and day out, you never achieve true mastery of the subjects you study or develop an educated mind.

In the last analysis, what we are communicates far more eloquently than anything we say or do. We all know it. There are people we trust absolutely because we know their character. Whether they’re eloquent or not, whether they have the human relations techniques or not, we trust them, and we work successfully with them.

Suppose you wanted to arrive at a specific location in central Chicago. A street map of the city would be a great help to you in reaching your destination. But suppose you were given the wrong map. Through a printing error, the map labeled “Chicago” was actually a map of Detroit. Can you imagine the frustration, the ineffectiveness of trying to reach your destination? You might work on your behavior—you could try harder, be more diligent, double your speed. But your efforts would only succeed in getting you to the wrong place faster. You might work on your attitude—you could think more positively. You still wouldn’t get to the right place, but perhaps you wouldn’t care. Your attitude would be so positive, you’d be happy wherever you were. The point is, you’d still be lost.

I frequently use this perception demonstration in working with people and organizations because it yields so many deep insights into both personal and interpersonal effectiveness. It shows, first of all, how powerfully conditioning affects our perceptions, our paradigms. If ten seconds can have that kind of impact on the way we see things, what about the conditioning of a lifetime? The influences in our lives—family, school, church, work environment, friends, associates, and current social paradigms such as the Personality Ethic—all have made their silent unconscious impact on us and help shape our frame of reference, our paradigms, our maps.

THE WAY WE SEE THE PROBLEM IS THE PROBLEM People are intrigued when they see good things happening in the lives of individuals, families, and organizations that are based on solid principles. They admire such personal strength and maturity, such family unity and teamwork, such adaptive synergistic organizational culture. And their immediate request is very revealing of their basic paradigm. “How do you do it? Teach me the techniques.” What they’re really saying is, “Give me some quick-fix advice or solution that will relieve the pain in my own situation.”

They may eliminate some of the cosmetic or acute problems through social aspirin and Band-Aids. But the underlying chronic condition remains, and eventually new acute symptoms will appear. The more people are into quick fixes and focus on the acute problems and pain, the more that very approach contributes to the underlying chronic condition.

I’ve attended time management seminars and I’ve tried half a dozen different planning systems. They’ve helped some, but I still don’t feel I’m living the happy, productive, peaceful life I want to live. The Personality Ethic tells me there must be something out there—some new planner or seminar that will help me handle all these pressures in a more efficient way. But is there a chance that efficiency is not the answer? Is getting more things done in less time going to make a difference—or will it just increase the pace at which I react to the people and circumstances that seem to control my life? Could there be something I need to see in a deeper, more fundamental way—some paradigm within myself that affects the way I see my time, my life, and my own nature?

As I travel around the country and work with organizations, I find that long-term thinking executives are simply turned off by psych-up psychology and “motivational” speakers who have nothing more to share than entertaining stories mingled with platitudes. They want substance; they want process. They want more than aspirin and Band-Aids. They want to solve the chronic underlying problems and focus on the principles that bring long-term results.

We need a new level, a deeper level of thinking—a paradigm based on the principles that accurately describe the territory of effective human being and interacting—to solve these deep concerns. This new level of thinking is what The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People is about. It’s a principle-centered, character-based, “inside-out” approach to personal and interpersonal effectiveness.

Those of us who watched the lunar voyage of Apollo 11 were transfixed as we saw the first men walk on the moon and return to earth. Superlatives such as “fantastic” and “incredible” were inadequate to describe those eventful days. But to get there, those astronauts literally had to break out of the tremendous gravity pull of the earth. More energy was spent in the first few minutes of lift-off, in the first few miles of travel, than was used over the next several days to travel half a million miles. Habits, too, have tremendous gravity pull—more than most people realize or would admit. Breaking deeply imbedded habitual tendencies such as procrastination, impatience, criticalness, or selfishness that violate basic principles of human effectiveness involves more than a little willpower and a few minor changes in our lives. “Liftoff” takes a tremendous effort, but once we break out of the gravity pull, our freedom takes on a whole new dimension.

It’s sometimes a painful process. It’s a change that has to be motivated by a higher purpose, by the willingness to subordinate what you think you want now for what you want later. But this process produces happiness, “the object and design of our existence.” Happiness can be defined, in part at least, as the fruit of the desire and ability to sacrifice what we want now for what we want eventually.

This fable is the story of a poor farmer who one day discovers in the nest of his pet goose a glittering golden egg. At first, he thinks it must be some kind of trick. But as he starts to throw the egg aside, he has second thoughts and takes it in to be appraised instead. The egg is pure gold! The farmer can’t believe his good fortune. He becomes even more incredulous the following day when the experience is repeated. Day after day, he awakens to rush to the nest and find another golden egg. He becomes fabulously wealthy; it all seems too good to be true. But with his increasing wealth comes greed and impatience. Unable to wait day after day for the golden eggs, the farmer decides he will kill the goose and get them all at once. But when he opens the goose, he finds it empty. There are no golden eggs—and now there is no way to get any more. The farmer has destroyed the goose that produced them. I suggest that within this fable is a natural law, a principle—the basic definition of effectiveness. Most people see effectiveness from the golden egg paradigm: the more you produce, the more you do, the more effective you are. But as the story shows, true effectiveness is a function of two things: what is produced (the golden eggs) and the producing asset or capacity to produce (the goose). If you adopt a pattern of life that focuses on golden eggs and neglects the goose, you will soon be without the asset that produces golden eggs. On the other hand, if you only take care of the goose with no aim toward the golden eggs, you soon won’t have the wherewithal to feed yourself or the goose. Effectiveness lies in the balance—what I call the P/PC Balance. P stands for production of desired results, the golden eggs. PC stands for production capability, the ability or asset that produces the golden eggs.

Our most important financial asset is our own capacity to earn. If we don’t continually invest in improving our own PC, we severely limit our options. We’re locked into our present situation, running scared of our corporation or our boss’s opinion of us, economically dependent and defensive. Again, it simply isn’t effective.

Suppose you want your daughter to have a clean room—that’s P, production, the golden egg. And suppose you want her to clean it—that’s PC, production capability. Your daughter is the goose, the asset, that produces the golden egg. If you have P and PC in balance, she cleans the room cheerfully, without being reminded, because she is committed and has the discipline to stay with the commitment. She is a valuable asset, a goose that can produce golden eggs. But if your paradigm is focused on production, on getting the room clean, you might find yourself nagging her to do it. You might even escalate your efforts to threatening or yelling, and in your desire to get the golden egg, you undermine the health and welfare of the goose.

The PC principle is to always treat your employees exactly as you want them to treat your best customers. You can buy a person’s hand, but you can’t buy his heart. His heart is where his enthusiasm, his loyalty is. You can buy his back, but you can’t buy his brain. That’s where his creativity is, his ingenuity, his resourcefulness.

Effectiveness lies in the balance. Excessive focus on P results in ruined health, worn-out machines, depleted bank accounts, and broken relationships. Too much focus on PC is like a person who runs three or four hours a day, bragging about the extra ten years of life it creates, unaware he’s spending them running. Or a person endlessly going to school, never producing, living on other people’s golden eggs—the eternal student syndrome.

To maintain the P/PC Balance, the balance between the golden egg (production) and the health and welfare of the goose (production capability) is often a difficult judgment call. But I suggest it is the very essence of effectiveness. It balances short term with long term. It balances going for the grade and paying the price to get an education. It balances the desire to have a room clean and the building of a relationship in which the child is internally committed to do it—cheerfully, willingly, without external supervision.

First, I would recommend that you not “see” this material as a book, in the sense that it is something to read once and put on a shelf. You may choose to read it completely through once for a sense of the whole. But the material is designed to be a companion in the continual process of change and growth. It is organized incrementally and with suggestions for application at the end of each habit so that you can study and focus on any particular habit as you are ready.

Second, I would suggest that you shift your paradigm of your own involvement in this material from the role of learner to that of teacher. Take an inside-out approach, and read with the purpose in mind of sharing or discussing what you learn with someone else within forty-eight hours after you learn it. If you had known, for example, that you would be teaching the material on the P/PC Balance principle to someone else within forty-eight hours, would it have made a difference in your reading experience? Try it now as you read the final section in this chapter. Read as though you are going to teach it to your spouse, your child, a business associate, or a friend today or tomorrow, while it is still fresh, and notice the difference in your mental and emotional process. I guarantee that if you approach the material in each of the following chapters in this way, you will not only better remember what you read, but your perspective will be expanded, your understanding deepened, and your motivation to apply the material increased. In addition, as you openly, honestly share what you’re learning with others, you may be surprised to find that negative labels or perceptions others may have of you tend to disappear. Those you teach will see you as a changing, growing person, and will be more inclined to be helpful and supportive as you work, perhaps together, to integrate the 7 Habits into your lives.

Welcome back. So how far did you get this time? Virtually everyone will get all the way to 54. What was the difference? The difference was that you had a method, an organizing model of some kind, that helped you navigate. Although this is a simple little game, the implications are profound. Our lives are much like numbers on a page. They are hard to navigate. There are so many choices and challenges. It’s so easy to get lost or to be less than effective.

Self-awareness enables us to stand apart and examine even the way we “see” ourselves—our self-paradigm, the most fundamental paradigm of effectiveness. It affects not only our attitudes and behaviors, but also how we see other people.

One day, naked and alone in a small room, he began to become aware of what he later called “the last of the human freedoms”—the freedom his Nazi captors could not take away. They could control his entire environment, they could do what they wanted to his body, but Viktor Frankl himself was a self-aware being who could look as an observer at his very involvement. His basic identity was intact. He could decide within himself how all of this was going to affect him. Between what happened to him, or the stimulus, and his response to it, was his freedom or power to choose that response.

In the midst of the most degrading circumstances imaginable, Frankl used the human endowment of self-awareness to discover a fundamental principle about the nature of man: Between stimulus and response, man has the freedom to choose. Within the freedom to choose are those endowments that make us uniquely human. In addition to self-awareness, we have imagination—the ability to create in our minds beyond our present reality. We have conscience—a deep inner awareness of right and wrong, of the principles that govern our behavior, and a sense of the degree to which our thoughts and actions are in harmony with them. And we have independent will—the ability to act based on our self-awareness, free of all other influences.

While the word proactivity is now fairly common in management literature, it is a word you won’t find in most dictionaries. It means more than merely taking initiative. It means that as human beings, we are responsible for our own lives. Our behavior is a function of our decisions, not our conditions. We can subordinate feelings to values. We have the initiative and the responsibility to make things happen.

Look at the word responsibility—“response-ability”—the ability to choose your response. Highly proactive people recognize that responsibility. They do not blame circumstances, conditions, or conditioning for their behavior. Their behavior is a product of their own conscious choice, based on values, rather than a product of their conditions, based on feeling.

Because we are, by nature, proactive, if our lives are a function of conditioning and conditions, it is because we have, by conscious decision or by default, chosen to empower those things to control us. In making such a choice, we become reactive. Reactive people are often affected by their physical environment.

The ability to subordinate an impulse to a value is the essence of the proactive person. Reactive people are driven by feelings, by circumstances, by conditions, by their environment. Proactive people are driven by values—carefully thought about, selected, and internalized values.

admit this is very hard to accept emotionally, especially if we have had years and years of explaining our misery in the name of circumstance or someone else’s behavior. But until a person can say deeply and honestly, “I am what I am today because of the choices I made yesterday,” that person cannot say, “I choose otherwise.”

We could separate those from things in which we have no particular mental or emotional involvement by creating a “Circle of Concern.” As we look at those things within our Circle of Concern, it becomes apparent that there are some things over which we have no real control and others that we can do something about. We could identify those concerns in the latter group by circumscribing them within a smaller Circle of Influence.

Proactive people focus their efforts in the Circle of Influence. They work on the things they can do something about. The nature of their energy is positive, enlarging and magnifying, causing their Circle of Influence to increase. Reactive people, on the other hand, focus their efforts in the Circle of Concern. They focus on the weakness of other people, the problems in the environment, and circumstances over which they have no control.

The problems we face fall in one of three areas: direct control (problems involving our own behavior); indirect control (problems involving other people’s behavior); or no control (problems we can do nothing about, such as our past or situational realities).

THE “HAVES” AND THE “BES” One way to determine which circle our concern is in is to distinguish between the haves and the bes. The Circle of Concern is filled with the haves: “I’ll be happy when I have my house paid off.” “If only I had a boss who wasn’t such a dictator…” “If only I had a more patient husband…” “If I had more obedient kids…” “If I had my degree…” “If I could just have more time to myself…” The Circle of Influence is filled with the bes—I can be more patient, be wise, be loving. It’s the character focus.

We empower what’s out there to control us. The change paradigm is “outside-in”—what’s out there has to change before we can change. The proactive approach is to change from the inside out: to be different, and by being different, to effect positive change in what’s out there—I can be more resourceful, I can be more diligent, I can be more creative, I can be more cooperative.

Undoubtedly, there have been times in each of our lives when we have picked up what we later felt was the wrong stick. Our choices have brought consequences we would rather have lived without. If we had the choice to make over again, we would make it differently. We call these choices mistakes, and they are the second thing that merits our deeper thought. For those filled with regret, perhaps the most needful exercise of proactivity is to realize that past mistakes are also out there in the Circle of Concern. We can’t recall them, we can’t undo them, we can’t control the consequences that came as a result.

It is not what others do or even our own mistakes that hurt us the most; it is our response to those things. Chasing after the poisonous snake that bites us will only drive the poison through our entire system. It is far better to take measures immediately to get the poison out. Our response to any mistake affects the quality of the next moment. It is important to immediately admit and correct our mistakes so that they have no power over that next moment and we are empowered again.

APPLICATION SUGGESTIONS For a full day, listen to your language and to the language of the people around you. How often do you use and hear reactive phrases such as “If only,” “I can’t,” or “I have to”? Identify an experience you might encounter in the near future where, based on past experience, you would probably behave reactively. Review the situation in the context of your Circle of Influence. How could you respond proactively? Take several moments and create the experience vividly in your mind, picturing yourself responding in a proactive manner. Remind yourself of the gap between stimulus and response. Make a commitment to yourself to exercise your freedom to choose. Select a problem from your work or personal life that is frustrating to you. Determine whether it is a direct, indirect, or no-control problem. Identify the first step you can take in your Circle of Influence to solve it and then take that step. Try the thirty-day test of proactivity. Be aware of the change in your Circle of Influence. NEW

APPLICATION SUGGESTIONS For a full day, listen to your language and to the language of the people around you. How often do you use and hear reactive phrases such as “If only,” “I can’t,” or “I have to”? Identify an experience you might encounter in the near future where, based on past experience, you would probably behave reactively. Review the situation in the context of your Circle of Influence. How could you respond proactively? Take several moments and create the experience vividly in your mind, picturing yourself responding in a proactive manner. Remind yourself of the gap between stimulus and response. Make a commitment to yourself to exercise your freedom to choose. Select a problem from your work or personal life that is frustrating to you. Determine whether it is a direct, indirect, or no-control problem. Identify the first step you can take in your Circle of Influence to solve it and then take that step. Try the thirty-day test of proactivity. Be aware of the change in your Circle of Influence.

Remember, being proactive is the first habit for a reason. You cannot practice any of the other habits until you first decide that you are in charge.

After all that’s been said and written, being proactive comes down to two things. First, take responsibility for your life; and second, take initiative. It’s that simple. Be an agent, not a victim. Don’t wait for life to happen to you; happen to it. Be the driver of your life, not just a passenger. Live out of your imagination, not your past.

Although Habit 2 applies to many different circumstances and levels of life, the most fundamental application of “begin with the end in mind” is to begin today with the image, picture, or paradigm of the end of your life as your frame of reference or the criterion by which everything else is examined.

Although Habit 2 applies to many different circumstances and levels of life, the most fundamental application of “begin with the end in mind” is to begin today with the image, picture, or paradigm of the end of your life as your frame of reference or the criterion by which everything else is examined. Each part of your life—today’s behavior, tomorrow’s behavior, next week’s behavior, next month’s behavior—can be examined in the context of the whole, of what really matters most to you. By keeping that end clearly in mind, you can make certain that whatever you do on any particular day does not violate the criteria you have defined as supremely important, and that each day of your life contributes in a meaningful way to the vision you have of your life as a whole.

“Begin with the end in mind” is based on the principle that all things are created twice. There’s a mental or first creation, and a physical or second creation, to all things. Take the construction of a home, for example. You create it in every detail before you ever hammer the first nail into place. You try to get a very clear sense of what kind of house you want. If you want a family-centered home, you plan to put a family room where it would be a natural gathering place. You plan sliding doors and a patio for children to play outside. You work with ideas. You work with your mind until you get a clear image of what you want to build.

The carpenter’s rule is “measure twice, cut once.” You have to make sure that the blueprint, the first creation, is really what you want, that you’ve thought everything through. Then you put it into bricks and mortar. Each day you go to the construction shed and pull out the blueprint to get marching orders for the day. You begin with the end in mind.

To varying degrees, people use this principle in many different areas of life. Before you go on a trip, you determine your destination and plan out the best route. Before you plant a garden, you plan it out in your mind, possibly on paper. You create speeches on paper before you give them, you envision the landscaping in your yard before you landscape it, you design the clothes you make before you thread the needle.

The unique human capacities of self-awareness, imagination, and conscience enable us to examine first creations and make it possible for us to take charge of our own first creation, to write our own script. Put another way, Habit 1 says, “You are the creator.” Habit 2 is the first creation.

Management is the second creation, which we’ll discuss in the chapter on Habit 3. But leadership has to come first. Management is a bottom-line focus: How can I best accomplish certain things? Leadership deals with the top line: What are the things I want to accomplish? In the words of both Peter Drucker and Warren Bennis, “Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things.” Management is efficiency in climbing the ladder of success; leadership determines whether the ladder is leaning against the right wall.

The two additional unique human endowments that enable us to expand our proactivity and to exercise personal leadership in our lives are imagination and conscience.

In developing our own self-awareness many of us discover ineffective scripts, deeply embedded habits that are totally unworthy of us, totally incongruent with the things we really value in life. Habit 2 says we don’t have to live with those scripts. We are response-able to use our imagination and creativity to write new ones that are more effective, more congruent with our deepest values and with the correct principles that give our values meaning.

Because I am self-aware, because I have imagination and conscience, I can examine my deepest values. I can realize that the script I’m living is not in harmony with those values, that my life is not the product of my own proactive design, but the result of the first creation I have deferred to circumstances and other people. And I can change. I can live out of my imagination instead of my memory. I can tie myself to my limitless potential instead of my limiting past. I can become my own first creator.

It means to be responsible for my own first creation, to rescript myself so that the paradigms from which my behavior and attitude flow are congruent with my deepest values and in harmony with correct principles.

Your security lies somewhere on the continuum between extreme insecurity on one end, wherein your life is buffeted by all the fickle forces that play upon it, and a deep sense of high intrinsic worth and personal security on the other end. Your guidance ranges on the continuum from dependence on the social mirror or other unstable, fluctuating sources to strong inner direction. Your wisdom falls somewhere between a totally inaccurate map where everything is distorted and nothing seems to fit, and a complete and accurate map of life wherein all the parts and principles are properly related to each other. Your power lies somewhere between immobilization or being a puppet pulled by someone else’s strings to high proactivity, the power to act according to your own values instead of being acted upon by other people and circumstances.

Efficient management without effective leadership is, as one individual has phrased it, “like straightening deck chairs on the Titanic.” No management success can compensate for failure in leadership. But leadership is hard because we’re often caught in a management paradigm.

Security represents your sense of worth, your identity, your emotional anchorage, your self-esteem, your basic personal strength or lack of it. Guidance means your source of direction in life. Encompassed by your map, your internal frame of reference that interprets for you what is happening out there, are standards or principles or implicit criteria that govern moment-by-moment decision-making and doing. Wisdom is your perspective on life, your sense of balance, your understanding of how the various parts and principles apply and relate to each other. It embraces judgment, discernment, comprehension. It is a gestalt or oneness, an integrated wholeness. Power is the faculty or capacity to act, the strength and potency to accomplish something. It is the vital energy to make choices and decisions. It also includes the capacity to overcome deeply embedded habits and to cultivate higher, more effective ones.

SPOUSE CENTEREDNESS. Marriage can be the most intimate, the most satisfying, the most enduring, growth-producing of human relationships. It might seem natural and proper to be centered on one’s husband or wife. But experience and observation tell a different story. Over the years, I have been involved in working with many troubled marriages, and I have observed a certain thread weaving itself through almost every spouse-centered relationship I have encountered. That thread is strong emotional dependence. If our sense of emotional worth comes primarily from our marriage, then we become highly dependent upon that relationship. We become vulnerable to the moods and feelings, the behavior and treatment of our spouse, or to any external event that may impinge on the relationship—a new child, in-laws, economic setbacks, social successes, and so forth.

When my sense of personal worth comes from my net worth, I am vulnerable to anything that will affect that net worth. But work and money, per se, provide no wisdom, no guidance, and only a limited degree of power and security. All it takes to show the limitations of a money center is a crisis in my life or in the life of a loved one.

Money-centered people often put aside family or other priorities, assuming everyone will understand that economic demands come first. I know one father who was leaving with his children for a promised trip to the circus when a phone call came for him to come to work instead. He declined. When his wife suggested that perhaps he should have gone to work, he responded, “The work will come again, but childhood won’t.” For the rest of their lives his children remembered this little act of priority setting, not only as an object lesson in their minds but as an expression of love in their hearts.

A PRINCIPLE CENTER By centering our lives on correct principles, we create a solid foundation for development of the four life-support factors.

Correct maps enable us to clearly see where we want to go and how to get there. We can make our decisions using the correct data that will make their implementation possible and meaningful. The personal power that comes from principle-centered living is the power of a self-aware, knowledgeable, proactive individual, unrestricted by the attitudes, behaviors, and actions of others or by many of the circumstances and environmental influences that limit other people. The only real limitation of power is the natural consequences of the principles themselves. We are free to choose our actions, based on our knowledge of correct principles, but we are not free to choose the consequences of those actions. Remember, “If you pick up one end of the stick, you pick up the other.”

Writing or reviewing a mission statement changes you because it forces you to think through your priorities deeply, carefully, and to align your behavior with your beliefs.

I recently finished reviewing my own mission statement, which I do fairly regularly. Sitting on the edge of a beach, alone, at the end of a bicycle ride, I took out my organizer and hammered it out. It took several hours, but I felt a sense of clarity, a sense of organization and commitment, a sense of exhilaration and freedom. I find the process is as important as the product. Writing or reviewing a mission statement changes you because it forces you to think through your priorities deeply, carefully, and to align your behavior with your beliefs. As you do, other people begin to sense that you’re not being driven by everything that happens to you. You have a sense of mission about what you’re trying to do and you are excited about it.I

“Assume you only have this one semester to live,” I tell my students, “and that during this semester you are to stay in school as a good student. Visualize how you would spend your semester.” Things are suddenly placed in a different perspective. Values quickly surface that before weren’t even recognized. I have also asked students to live with that expanded perspective for a week and keep a diary of their experiences. The results are very revealing. They start writing to parents to tell them how much they love and appreciate them. They reconcile with a brother, a sister, a friend where the relationship has deteriorated. The dominant, central theme of their activities, the underlying principle, is love. The futility of bad-mouthing, bad thinking, put-downs, and accusation becomes very evident when they think in terms of having only a short time to live. Principles and values become more evident to everybody.

I can use my right brain power of visualization to write an “affirmation” that will help me become more congruent with my deeper values in my daily life. A good affirmation has five basic ingredients: it’s personal, it’s positive, it’s present tense, it’s visual, and it’s emotional. So I might write something like this: “It is deeply satisfying (emotional) that I (personal) respond (present tense) with wisdom, love, firmness, and self-control (positive) when my children misbehave.” Then

Among Christensen’s classmates, many were estranged from their families, others were in prison, and still others were living unhappy lives. None of them started off thinking, “I want to live the kind of life where my kids won’t speak to me,” or “I want to commit fraud,” or “I want to be completely unfulfilled.” But because they didn’t carefully think through what matters most and because they repeatedly made small compromising decisions over a long period, they found themselves in a completely different place than they had intended to be.

as we examine this endowment in the context of effective self-management, we realize it’s usually not the dramatic, the visible, the once-in-a-lifetime, up-by-the-bootstraps effort that brings enduring success. Empowerment comes from learning how to use this great endowment in the decisions we make every day. The degree to which we have developed our independent will in our everyday lives is measured by our personal integrity. Integrity is, fundamentally, the value we place on ourselves. It’s our ability to make and keep commitments to ourselves, to “walk our talk.” It’s honor with self, a fundamental part of the Character Ethic, the essence of proactive growth.

In other words, if you are an effective manager of yourself, your discipline comes from within; it is a function of your independent will. You are a disciple, a follower, of your own deep values and their source. And you have the will, the integrity, to subordinate your feelings, your impulses, your moods to those values.

That subordination requires a purpose, a mission, a Habit 2 clear sense of direction and value, a burning “yes!” inside that makes it possible to say “no” to other things. It also requires independent will, the power to do something when you don’t want to do it, to be a function of your values rather than a function of the impulse or desire of any given moment. It’s the power to act with integrity to your proactive first creation.

Importance, on the other hand, has to do with results. If something is important, it contributes to your mission, your values, your high-priority goals. We react to urgent matters. Important matters that are not urgent require more initiative, more proactivity. We must act to seize opportunity, to make things happen. If we don’t practice Habit 2, if we don’t have a clear idea of what is important, of the results we desire in our lives, we are easily diverted into responding to the urgent.

Quadrant II is the heart of effective personal management. It deals with things that are not urgent, but are important.

But you have to decide what your highest priorities are and have the courage—pleasantly, smilingly, nonapologetically—to say “no” to other things.

The fourth-generation tool recognizes that principle. It also recognizes that the first person you need to consider in terms of effectiveness rather than efficiency is yourself. It encourages you to spend time in Quadrant II, to understand and center your life on principles, to give clear expression to the purposes and values you want to direct your daily decisions. It helps you to create balance in your life. It helps you rise above the limitations of daily planning and organize and schedule in the context of the week. And when a higher value conflicts with what you have planned, it empowers you to use your self-awareness and your conscience to maintain integrity to the principles and purposes you have determined are most important. Instead of using a road map, you’re using a compass.

DELEGATION: INCREASING P AND PC We accomplish all that we do through delegation—either to time or to other people. If we delegate to time, we think efficiency. If we delegate to other people, we think effectiveness.

Many people refuse to delegate to other people because they feel it takes too much time and effort and they could do the job better themselves. But effectively delegating to others is perhaps the single most powerful high-leverage activity there

But when a person sets up and works with and through people and systems to produce golden eggs, that person becomes a manager in the interdependent sense. A parent who delegates washing the dishes to a child is a manager. An architect who heads a team of other architects is a manager. A secretary who supervises other secretaries and office personnel is an office manager.

A parent who delegates washing the dishes to a child is a manager. An architect who heads a team of other architects is a manager. A secretary who supervises other secretaries and office personnel is an office manager. A producer can invest one hour of effort and produce one unit of results, assuming no loss of efficiency. A manager, on the other hand, can invest one hour of effort and produce ten or fifty or a hundred units through effective delegation.

STEWARDSHIP DELEGATION Stewardship delegation is focused on results instead of methods. It gives people a choice of method and makes them responsible for results. It takes more time in the beginning, but it’s time well invested. You can move the fulcrum over, you can increase your leverage, through stewardship delegation.

Let people learn from your mistakes or the mistakes of others. Point out the potential failure paths, what not to do, but don’t tell them what to do. Keep the responsibility for results with them—to do whatever is necessary within the guidelines.

“Now, before you decide whether or not you’re going to take the job, let me tell you a few more things. Because when you take the job, I don’t do it anymore. It’s your job. It’s called a stewardship. Stewardship means ‘a job with a trust.’ I trust you to do the job, to get it done. Now who’s going to be your boss?”

The principles involved in stewardship delegation are correct and applicable to any kind of person or situation. With immature people, you specify fewer desired results and more guidelines, identify more resources, conduct more frequent accountability interviews, and apply more immediate consequences. With more mature people, you have more challenging desired results, fewer guidelines, less frequent accountability, and less measurable but more discernable criteria. Effective delegation is perhaps the best indicator of effective management simply because it is so basic to both personal and organizational growth.

“Unlike a century ago, when Americans showed their status in leisure time, busyness has become the new badge of honor. So even as we bemoan workplaces where everyone is busy and no one is productive, busyness has actually become the way to signal dedication to the job and leadership potential. One reason for this is that, while productivity is relatively easy to measure on a factory floor, or on the farm, we have yet to develop good metrics for measuring the productivity of knowledge workers. So we largely rely on hours worked and face time in the office as markers for effort, and with the advent of technology and the ability to work remotely, being connected and responsive at all hours is the new face time.”II

What Comes Next The book is divided into five parts. Part 1 presents the basic elements of a two-systems approach to judgment and choice. It elaborates the distinction between the automatic operations of System 1 and the controlled operations of System 2, and shows how associative memory, the core of System 1, continually constructs a coherent interpretation of what is going on in our world at any instant.

Part 2 updates the study of judgment heuristics and explores a major puzzle: Why is it so difficult for us to think statistically? We easily think associativelm 1associay, we think metaphorically, we think causally, but statistics requires thinking about many things at once, which is something that System 1 is not designed to do.

Amos told the class about an ongoing program of research at the University of Michigan that sought to answer this question: Are people good intuitive statisticians? We already knew that people are good intuitive grammarians: at age four a child effortlessly conforms to the rules of grammar as she speaks, although she has no idea that such rules exist. Do people have a similar intuitive feel for the basic principles of statistics? Amos reported that the answer was a qualified yes. We had a lively debate in the seminar and ultimately concluded that a qualified no was a better answer.

The resemblance of Steve’s personality to that of a stereotypical librarian strikes everyone immediately, but equally relevant statistical considerations are almost always ignored. Did it occur to you that there are more than 20 male farmers for each male librarian in the United States? Because there are so many more farmers, it is almost certain that more “meek and tidy” souls will be found on tractors than at library information desks. However, we found that participants in our experiments ignored the relevant statistical facts and relied exclusively on resemblance.

Because there are so many more farmers, it is almost certain that more “meek and tidy” souls will be found on tractors than at library information desks. However, we found that participants in our experiments ignored the relevant statistical facts and relied exclusively on resemblance. We proposed that they used resemblance as a simplifying heuristic (roughly, a rule of thumb) to make a difficult judgment. The reliance on the heuristic caused predictable biases (systematic errors) in their predictions.

For reasons that I explain more fully in the next chapter, I describe mental life by the metaphor of two agents, called System 1 and System 2, which respectively produce fast and slow thinking. I speak of the features of intuitive and deliberate thought as if they were traits and dispositions of two characters in your mind. In the picture that emerges from recent research, the intuitive System 1 is more influential than your experience tells you, and it is the secret author of many of the choices and judgments you make. Most of this book is about the workings of System 1 and the mutual influences between it and System 2.

TWO SYSTEMS Psychologists have been intensely interested for several decades in the two modes of thinking evoked by the picture of the angry woman and by the multiplication problem, and have offered many labels for them. I adopt terms originally proposed by the psychologists Keith Stanovich and Richard West, and will refer to two systems in the mind, System 1 and System 2. System 1 operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control. System 2 allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations. The operations of System 2 are often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration.

The automatic operations of System 1 generate surprisingly complex patterns of ideas, but only the slower System 2 can construct thoughts in an orderly series of steps. I also describe circumstances in which System 2 takes over, overruling the freewheeling impulses and associations of System 1.

As you can easily confirm by measuring them with a ruler, the horizontal lines are in fact identical in length. Figure 3 Now that you have measured the lines, you—your System 2, the conscious being you call “I”—have a new belief: you know that the lines are equally long. If asked about their length, you will say what you know. But you still see the bottom line as longer. You have chosen to believe the measurement, but you cannot prevent System 1 from doing its thing; you cannot decide to see the lines as equal, although you know they are.

To resist the illusion, there is only one thing you can do: you must learn to mistrust your impressions of the length of lines when fins are attached to them. To implement that rule, you must be able to recognize the illusory pattern and recall what you know about it. If you can do this, you will never again be fooled by the Müller-Lyer illusion. But you will still see one line as longer than the other.

As a way to live your life, however, continuous vigilance is not necessarily good, and it is certainly impractical. Constantly questioning our own thinking would be impossibly tedious, and System 2 is much too slow and inefficient to serve as a substitute for System 1 in making routine decisions. The best we can do is a compromise: learn to recognize situations in which mistakes are likely and try harder to avoid significant mistakes when the stakes are high. The premise of this book is that it is easier to recognize other people’s mistakes than our own.

Why call them System 1 and System 2 rather than the more descriptive “automatic system” and “effortful system”? The reason is simple: “Automatic system” takes longer to say than “System 1” and therefore takes more space in your working memory. This matters, because anything that occupies your working memory reduces your ability to think. You should treat “System 1” and “System 2” as nicknames, like Bob and Joe, identifying characters that you will get to know over the course of this book. The fictitious systems make it easier for me to think about judgment and choice, and will make it easier for you to understand what I say.

One of Hess’s findings especially captured my attention. He had noticed that the pupils are sensitive indicators of mental effort—they dilate substantially when people multiply two-digit numbers, and they dilate more if the problems are hard than if they are easy. His observations indicated that the response to mental effort is distinct from emotional arousal.

As you become skilled in a task, its demand for energy diminishes. Studies of the brain have shown that the pattern of activity associated with an action changes as skill increases, with fewer brain regions involved. Talent has similar effects. Highly intelligent individuals need less effort to solve the same problems, as indicated by both pupil size and brain activity. A general “law of least effort” applies to cognitive as well as physical exertion. The law asserts that if there are several ways of achieving the same goal, people will eventually gravitate to the least demanding course of action. In the economy of action, effort is a cost, and the acquisition of skill is driven by the balance of benefits and costs. Laziness is built deep into our nature.

System 2 is the only one that can follow rules, compare objects on several attributes, and make deliberate choices between options. The automatic System 1 does not have these capabilities. System 1 detects simple relations (“they are all alike,” “the son is much taller than the father”) and excels at integrating information about one thing, but it does not deal with multiple distinct topics at once, nor is it adept at using purely statistical information. System 1 will detect that a person described as “a meek and tidy soul, with a need for order and structure, and a passion for detail” resembles a caricature librarian, but combining this intuition with knowledge about the small number of librarians is a task that only System 2 can perform—if System 2 knows how to do so, which is true of few people.

The psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (pronounced six-cent-mihaly) has done more than anyone else to study this state of effortless attending, and the name he proposed for it, flow, has become part of the language. People who experience flow describe it as “a state of effortless concentration so deep that they lose their sense of time, of themselves, of their problems,” and their descriptions of the joy of that state are so compelling that Csikszentmihalyi has called it an “optimal experience.

Memorizing and repeating digits loosens the hold of System 2 on behavior, but of course cognitive load is not the only cause of weakened self-control.

A series of surprising experiments by the psychologist Roy Baumeister and his colleagues has shown conclusively that all variants of voluntary effort—cognitive, emotional, or physical—draw at least partly on a shared pool of mental energy. Their experiments involve successive rather than simultaneous tasks. Baumeister’s group has repeatedly found that an effort of will or self-control is tiring; if you have had to force yourself to do something, you are less willing or less able to exert self-control when the next challenge comes around.

The emotional effort in the first phase of the experiment reduces the ability to withstand the pain of sustained muscle contraction, and ego-depleted people therefore succumb more quickly to the urge to quit. In another experiment, people are first depleted by a task in which they eat virtuous foods such as radishes and celery while resisting the temptation to indulge in chocolate and rich cookies. Later, these people will give up earlier than normal when faced with a difficult cognitive task.

The evidence is persuasive: activities that impose high demands on System 2 require self-control, and the exertion of self-control is depleting and unpleasant. Unlike cognitive load, ego depletion is at least in part a loss of motivation.

The bold implication of this idea is that the effects of ego depletion could be undone by ingesting glucose, and Baumeister and his colleagues have confirmed this hypothesis in several experiments. Volunteers in one of their studies watched a short silent film of a woman being interviewed and were asked to interpret her body language. While they were performing the task, a series of words crossed the screen in slow succession. The participants were specifically instructed to ignore the words, and if they found their attention drawn away they had to refocus their concentration on the woman’s behavior. This act of self-control was known to cause ego depletion. All the volunteers drank some lemonade before participating in a second task. The lemonade was sweetened with glucose for half of them and with Splenda for the others. Then all participants were given a task in which they needed to overcome an intuitive response to get the correct answer. Intuitive errors are normally much more frequent among ego-depleted people, and the drinkers of Splenda showed the expected depletion effect. On the other hand, the glucose drinkers were not depleted. Restoring the level of available sugar in the brain had prevented the deterioration of performance. It will take some time and much further research to establish whether the tasks that cause glucose-depletion also cause the momentary arousal that is reflected in increases of pupil size and heart rate.

In a second or so you accomplished, automatically and unconsciously, a remarkable feat. Starting from a completely unexpected event, your System 1 made as much sense as possible of the situation—two simple words, oddly juxtaposed—by linking the words in a causal story; it evaluated the possible threat (mild to moderate) and created a context for future developments by preparing you for events that had just become more likely; it also created a context for the current event by evaluating how surprising it was. You ended up as informed about the past and as prepared for the future as you could be. An odd feature of what happened is that your System 1 treated the mere conjunction of two words as representations of reality. Your body reacted in an attenuated replica of a reaction to the real thing, and the emotional response and physical recoil were part of the interpretation of the event. As cognitive scientists have emphasized in recent years, cognition is embodied; you think with your body, not only with your brain.

The researchers tallied the frequency of responses, such as “night,” “sunny,” or “long.” In the 1980s, psychologists discovered that exposure to a word causes immediate and measurable changes in the ease with which many related words can be evoked. If you have recently seen or heard the word EAT, you are temporarily more likely to complete the word fragment SO_P as SOUP than as SOAP. The opposite would happen, of course, if you had just seen WASH. We call this a priming effect and say that the idea of EAT primes the idea of SOUP, and that WASH primes SOAP.

The ideomotor link also works in reverse. A study conducted in a German university was the mirror image of the early experiment that Bargh and his colleagues had carried out in New York. Students were asked to walk around a room for 5 minutes at a rate of 30 steps per minute, which was about one-third their normal pace. After this brief experience, the participants were much quicker to recognize words related to old age, such as forgetful, old, and lonely. Reciprocal priming effects tend to produce a coherent reaction: if you were primed to think of old age, you would tend to act old, and acting old would reinforce the thought of old age.

In one demonstration, people were asked to listen to messages through new headphones. They were told that the purpose of the experiment was to test the quality of the audio equipment and were instructed to move their heads repeatedly to check for any distortions of sound. Half the participants were told to nod their head up and down while others were told to shake it side to side. The messages they heard were radio editorials. Those who nodded (a yes gesture) tended to accept the message they heard, but those who shook their head tended to reject it. Again, there was no awareness, just a habitual connection between an attitude of rejection or acceptance and its common physical expression. You can see why the common admonition to “act calm and kind regardless of how you feel” is very good advice: you are likely to be rewarded by actually feeling calm and kind.

The general theme of these findings is that the idea of money primes individualism: a reluctance to be involved with others, to depend on others, or to accept demands from others. The psychologist who has done this remarkable research, Kathleen Vohs, has been laudably restrained in discussing the implications of her findings, leaving the task to her readers. Her experiments are profound—her findings suggest that living in a culture that surrounds us with reminders of money may shape our behavior and our attitudes in ways that we do not know about and of which we may not be proud. Some cultures provide frequent reminders of respect, others constantly remind their members of God, and some societies prime obedience by large images of the Dear Leader. Can there be any doubt that the ubiquitous portraits of the national leader in dictatorial societies not only convey the feeling that “Big Brother Is Watching” but also lead to an actual reduction in spontaneous thought and independent action?

You do not believe that these results apply to you because they correspond to nothing in your subjective experience.

The various causes of ease or strain have interchangeable effects. When you are in a state of cognitive ease, you are probably in a good mood, like what you see, believe what you hear, trust your intuitions, and feel that the current situation is comfortably familiar. You are also likely to be relatively casual and superficial in your thinking. When you feel strained, you are more likely to be vigilant and suspicious, invest more effort in what you are doing, feel less comfortable, and make fewer errors, but you also are less intuitive and less creative than usual.

The experimenters recruited 40 Princeton students to take the CRT. Half of them saw the puzzles in a small font in washed-out gray print. The puzzles were legible, but the font induced cognitive strain. The results tell a clear story: 90% of the students who saw the CRT in normal font made at least one mistake in the test, but the proportion dropped to 35% when the font was barely legible. You read this correctly: performance was better with the bad font. Cognitive strain, whatever its source, mobilizes System 2, which is more likely to reject the intuitive answer suggested by System 1.

The consequences of repeated exposures benefit the organism in its relations to the immediate animate and inanimate environment. They allow the organism to distinguish objects and habitats that are safe from those that are not, and they are the most primitive basis of social attachments. Therefore, they form the basis for social organization and cohesion—the basic sources of psychological and social stability.

Another remarkable discovery is the powerful effect of mood on this intuitive performance. The experimenters computed an “intuition index” to measure accuracy. They found that putting the participants in a good mood before the test by having them think happy thoughts more than doubled accuracy. An even more striking result is that unhappy subjects were completely incapable of performing the intuitive task accurately; their guesses were no better than random. Mood evidently affects the operation of System 1: when we are uncomfortable and unhappy, we lose touch with our intuition.

These findings add to the growing evidence that good mood, intuition, creativity, gullibility, and increased reliance on System 1 form a cluster. At the other pole, sadness, vigilance, suspicion, an analytic approach, and increased effort also go together. A happy mood loosens the control of System 2 over performance: when in a good mood, people become more intuitive and more creative but also less vigilant and more prone to logical errors.

A happy mood loosens the control of System 2 over performance: when in a good mood, people become more intuitive and more creative but also less vigilant and more prone to logical errors. Here again, as in the mere exposure effect, the connection makes biological sense. A good mood is a signal that things are generally going well, the environment is safe, and it is all right to let one’s guard down. A bad mood indicates that things are not going very well, there may be a threat, and vigilance is required. Cognitive ease is both a cause and a consequence of a pleasant feeling.

Jumping to conclusions is efficient if the conclusions are likely to be correct and the costs of an occasional mistake acceptable, and if the jump saves much time and effort. Jumping to conclusions is risky when the situation is unfamiliar, the stakes are high, and there is no time to collect more information. These are the circumstances in which intuitive errors are probable, which may be prevented by a deliberate intervention of System 2.

You could just as well have read them as A 13 C or 12 B 14, but you did not. Why not? The same shape is read as a letter in a context of letters and as a number in a context of numbers.

Gilbert sees unbelieving as an operation of System 2, and he reported an elegant experiment to make his point. The participants saw nonsensical assertions, such as “a dinca is a flame,” followed after a few seconds by a single word, “true” or “false.” They were later tested for their memory of which sentences had been labeled “true.” In one condition of the experiment subjects were required to hold digits in memory during the task. The disruption of System 2 had a selective effect: it made it difficult for people to “unbelieve” false sentences. In a later test of memory, the depleted participants ended up thinking that many of the false sentences were true. The moral is significant: when System 2 is otherwise engaged, we will believe almost anything. System 1 is gullible and biased to believe, System 2 is in charge of doubting and unbelieving, but System 2 is sometimes busy, and often lazy. Indeed, there is evidence that people are more likely to be influenced by empty persuasive messages, such as commercials, when they are tired and depleted.

And on freeing yourself from all other distractions. Yes, you can—if you do everything as if it were the last thing you were doing in your life, and stop being aimless, stop letting your emotions override what your mind tells you, stop being hypocritical, self-centered, irritable. You see how few things you have to do to live a satisfying and reverent life? If you can manage this, that’s all even the gods can ask of you.

The longest amounts to the same as the shortest. The present is the same for everyone; its loss is the same for everyone; and it should be clear that a brief instant is all that is lost. For you can’t lose either the past or the future; how could you lose what you don’t have?

1. Not just that every day more of our life is used up and less and less of it is left, but this too: if we live longer, can we be sure our mind will still be up to understanding the world—to the contemplation that aims at divine and human knowledge? If our mind starts to wander, we’ll still go on breathing, go on eating, imagining things, feeling urges and so on. But getting the most out of ourselves, calculating where our duty lies, analyzing what we hear and see, deciding whether it’s time to call it quits—all the things you need a healthy mind for … all those are gone. So we need to hurry. Not just because we move daily closer to death but also because our understanding—our grasp of the world—may be gone before we get there.

An old proverb has mutated a few times, but the gist is this: “If you want to keep getting what you’re getting, keep doing what you’re doing.” The translation? STOP! If you aren’t wealthy, STOP doing what you’re doing. STOP following conventional wisdom and using the wrong formula. STOP following the financial plan that prioritizes survival or thriving. I call it “anti-advice,” and much of this book follows this prescription. This book lists nearly 300 wealth distinctions designed to crack the code to wealth so you can expose wealth’s asymmetrical shortcut. The distinctions are directional markers to “STOP” your old ways of thinking and acting and reorient you into a new direction. In essence, you must unlearn what you have learned.

Speaking of front doors, my home looks (and sometimes feels) more like a luxurious private resort rather than a single-family home. With nearly 13,000 square feet at the base of the beautiful Wasatch mountains in Alpine, Utah, the word “house” is an understatement. It has everything one could want and more. A lush backyard with its own private creek putting most national park campgrounds to shame? Check. Indoor basketball court, a private gym, an expansive library, and a booming home theater that could rival any commercial cineplex? Check. Lap pool and a ten-person hot tub for raucous late-night parties? Check. (Just joking about the parties!) In the mood to shoot pool or a few games of pop-a-shot? Perhaps a round of pickleball, ping-pong, or darts? No problem, good times are rolling at the DeMarco crib.

Whichever financial roadmap you follow will predispose you to the destination inherent in the roadmap—the roadmap’s “true essence.” What is true essence? If you play blackjack and win 15 consecutive hands, you violate the true essence of randomness. The natural state of randomness is to not deliver 15 wins in a row. When a wild African lion is tamed to perform in a Las Vegas magic act, the lion is trained to violate its true essence. The lion naturally wants to be wild, hunt, kill, feed, and mate. The lion wants to revert to its natural self, which is why some flamboyant magicians get their heads bitten off. You must be special to bend the laws of true essence.

Each roadmap contains key mindsets that act as signposts, or “mindposts,” that provide direction and guide actions, just like a roadmap. Those mindposts are: Debt Perception: Does debt control you, or do you control your debt? Or do you even have debt? Time Perception: How is your time valued and treated? Abundant? Fleeting? Inconsequential? Do you work for time? Or does time work for you? Education Perception: What role does education have in your life? Does it have a role at all? Money Perception: What is money’s default position in your life? Is money a tool or a toy? Plentiful or scarce? Evil or good? Primary Income Source: What are your primary means of creating income? Primary Wealth Accelerator: How are you accelerating your net worth and creating wealth? Or are you? Wealth Perception: How do you define wealth? Wealth Equation: What is your mathematical plan for accumulating wealth? What wealth equation defines the physics of your wealth universe? Destination: Is there a destination?

The Income/Wealth Mirage of the Sidewalk Notice how both income-poor and income-rich Sidewalkers share the same problems but different scenery. The reason is that more money is not a solution to poor financial management. Poor money management is like gambling at a casino because, over time, the house always wins. Tossing more money at the deficiency is like plugging a melon-sized hole in a dam with a toothpick. More money doesn’t buy financial discipline.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions A first-class ticket to the Sidewalk is to have no financial plan. The Sidewalk’s natural gravitational pull is poverty, both in time and money. You cannot solve poor financial management with more money. You can be income rich and still ride the Sidewalk dirty. Lifestyle Servitude on the Sidewalk grows from excess consumption seeded by instant gratification, image management, and debt. If wealth is defined by income and debt, wealth is an illusion because it is vulnerable to potholes, detours, and “bumps in the road.” When the income disappears, so does the illusion of wealth. Poor financial management is like gambling; the house eventually wins.

Wealth is not authored by material possessions, money, or “stuff,” but by what I call the three fundamental “F's”: family (relationships), fitness (health), and freedom (choice, both fiscally and personally). You will find true wealth and, yes, happiness within this wealth trinity. Wealth is strong-spirited familial relationships with people. Not just your family, but with people, your community, your God or spirituality, and your friends. At the end of the iconic movie, It's A Wonderful Life, we're given the final lesson: “Remember, no man is a failure who has friends.” This reflects the importance of having your life shared with friends, family, and loved ones. Wealth is making a difference. Wealth is the community and impacting the lives of others. Wealth cannot be experienced alone in a vacuum. The richest moments of my life occurred when I was surrounded by friends or loved ones.

If you don't have health, you lack wealth. Ask any terminally ill person what they value. Ask cancer survivors how they suddenly feel reborn, and happiness is displaced from “stuff” to people and experiences. There is no price on health and vibrancy. And finally, the big one, the one culture wants to ignore… wealth is freedom and choice. Wealth is the autonomy to live how you want, what, when, and where.

Henry Sukarano buys his dream house in the Baltimore suburbs for $3.2 million. As a pharmaceutical representative for one of the leading drug makers, Henry's career is on the fast track even though he finds the job oppressively time consuming and unfulfilling. He justifies the purchase as a reward to his sacrifice. The sprawling home has everything he wants, including a pool, horse stables, and an impressive five-car garage. After eight weeks when the “congratulations” and accolades from his peers disappears, the feeling of satisfaction also disappears, but the thirty-year mortgage remains. Despite the reward, Henry commutes two hours daily and his job is still not fulfilling. He's either on the road, on a plane, or sleeping. The long, unsatisfying hours have disturbing clarity: Henry rarely “lives” at his dream home, and when he does, he spends it resting or recharging from the hustle of the workweek. His relationship with his wife and kids suffers. His health declines as the stress of responsibility mounts. Henry comes to a moment of truth: “I'm not living a dream, but my dream is living me.” Feeling trapped by the lifestyle illusion, Henry continues to work, believing the ideology that success has its price.

These analyses fall short because they don't isolate the natural thief of happiness: servitude, the antithesis of freedom. The irony is that when most people earn “more money,” it doesn't expand freedom; it contracts. The Sidewalk manifests Lifestyle Servitude wrought from overconsumption and overspending thanks to higher earnings or favorable income forecasts. And any form of Lifestyle Servitude is destructive to the wealth trinity: family, fitness, and freedom.

Normalcy Is the Rat Race, a Modern-Day Slavery Why am I wealthy versus the guy stuck in morning traffic driving to work? I have freedom. I wake up and do what I want. I pursue dreams. I write this book without worrying about how many will sell. I hop a plane to Las Vegas for a week without worrying about jobs, bosses, or unpaid electric bills. I waltz into a store and buy whatever I want, prices immaterial to the decision. Simply put, both time and financial freedom are fantastic.

Money secures one agent of the wealth formula, freedom, which is a powerful guardian to wealth's sibling ingredients: health and relationships. Money buys the freedom to watch your kids grow up. Money buys the freedom to pursue your craziest dreams. Money buys the freedom to make a difference in the world. Money buys the freedom to build and strengthen relationships. Money buys the freedom to do what you love, removing financial validation from the equation.

Lifestyle Servitude: The Trap of the Sidewalk I inadvertently learned about Lifestyle Servitude in my early twenties. After college graduation, I took a hellacious job as a construction laborer in Chicago and fought city traffic daily. The pay was more than I had ever earned at my young age, and with my increase in income, I felt wealthy. So, what did I do? I elevated my lifestyle and financed the illusion of wealth. I bought my first sports car, a Mitsubishi 3000GT. It didn't take long for me to realize that my dream car wasn't a wealth icon but a parasite that fed on my freedom. I hated my job: it was stressful, drained my energy, and left my entrepreneurial dreams tethered. I couldn't quit. I had responsibilities: car payments, gas, and insurance. Because of my obligations to “stuff,” I imprisoned myself in a job I loathed. Yet, this cycle of servitude is standard.

In other words, if you buy a boat, pay cash, and are NOT affected by unexpected “bumps in the road,” you can afford it. Would you regret a gum purchase if you lost your job a week later? Or if your sales forecast was slashed by 50%? Nope, it wouldn't make a difference. This is how affordability is measured against your level of wealth.

Wealth, like health, isn't easy. Both are cut from the same fabric with identical processes. They require discipline, sacrifice, persistence, commitment, and yes, delayed gratification. If you can't immunize yourself from the temptations of instant gratification, you'll be hard-pressed to find success in either health or wealth. Both demand a lifestyle shift from short-term thinking (instant gratification) to long-term thinking (delayed gratification). This is the only defense to Lifestyle Servitude.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions Money doesn't buy happiness because money is used for consumer pursuits destructive to freedom. Anything detrimental to freedom is dangerous to the wealth trinity. Money, properly used, can buy freedom, which can lead to happiness.  Happiness stems from good health, freedom, and strong interpersonal relationships, not necessarily money. Lifestyle Servitude steals freedom, and what steals freedom, steals wealth. If you think you can afford it, you can't. The consequence of instant gratification is the destruction of freedom, health, and choice.

It's the removal of your yellow brick road and the sharpening lessons from it. Sidewalkers seek “big hits” because their belief system tells them wealth is an event.

The road to victimhood is through denial: First responsibility, then accountability. People who don't take responsibility are victims. Some of them are born victims and instead of trying to improve their hands, they fold and give up. For them, everyone has the solution to their problems but them. And their problems? Not their fault. Nope, someone else is to blame. Instead of looking within, they look outward and project responsibility to some other entity. Victims are Sidewalkers who refuse to take the driver's seat of their own lives and live under a dark cloud of “theys” reflective of a “me against them” attitude.

A Fastlane Forum user does a great job distinguishing between responsibility and accountability: What kills me is when people make the same piss-poor choice multiple times but then claim to be responsible. It's easy to be “responsible” when responsible means just walking away. I've seen single parents who pledge to be “responsible” for the wild oats they've sown, only to occasionally send a check in the mail. I've seen people walk away from homes, claiming to be “responsible” for their actions, only to buy another home they can't afford. I've seen people being “responsible” for the actions their drinking and driving caused only to do it again! I am sick and tired of people being “responsible!” I want people to be accountable. People need to think before they act. Own their choices before they make them. I am okay with people making mistakes—but freaking own that you made a mistake and learn from it.

Chapter 10 The Lie You’ve Been Sold: The Slowlane What if I told you ‘insane’ was working fifty hours a week in some office for fifty years at the end of which they tell you to piss off; ending up in some retirement village hoping to die before suffering the indignity of trying to make it to the toilet on time? Wouldn’t you consider that to be insane? (Steve Buscemi, Con Air, Paramount Pictures, 2003)

While the Sidewalk is a lifestyle that mortgages the future for a comfortable today, the Slowlane is the opposite: a sacrificial today in the hopes of a more comfortable tomorrow.

Surprisingly, the Slowlane is the Sidewalk’s first convenient exit and evolves from maturity and increased adult responsibilities. Most college graduates begin their post-schooling life on the Sidewalk. I certainly did. Graduation sanctioned a license to buy stuff that yielded instant pleasure: trips to Cancun, a flashy car with a booming stereo, nightly drinking binges, and a massive music collection. Life was all about now, regardless of future consequences. Sidewalkers (and people in general) instinctively regard a better future: “I’ll be making more money,” “My sport bets on DraftKings will hit it big,” and “After my father dies, I’ll inherit thousands.” Future crutches justify pleasurable nows and, behind the scenes, Lifestyle Servitude swells.

While the Sidewalk is typified by undisciplined behavior, the Slowlane’s financial plan introduces responsibility and accountability into the wealth formula. That can’t be bad, right? Unfortunately, the Slowlane is like wrong directions given at a gas station, except these directions aren’t offered by strangers, but by people you trust: teachers, television and radio/podcast personalities, financial advisers, and yes, even our parents.

You can either live rich young or live rich old while risking death along the way. The choice is yours, and it shouldn’t be a contest. Rich at 25 years old beats the snot out of rich at 65 years old. Ask a youngster how to get rich young. Will coupons, indexed funds, and 401(k)s be the answer? Comedic, I know.

Friday evening is celebrated because people are rejoicing the dividends of their trade: five days of work-bondage exchanged for two days of unadulterated freedom. Saturday and Sunday are the payment for Monday through Friday. Friday evening symbolizes the emergence of that payment, freedom for two days. The prostitution of Monday through Friday is why “Thank God it’s Friday” exists. On Friday, people are paid FREEDOM in the currency of Saturday and Sunday.

People bankrupt with time witness their freedom, families, and relationships disintegrate. Time is mismanaged because the Slowlane is predicated on time. Five days of servitude for two days of freedom is not a good trade unless you trade time into a system that can give you a better return on your time.

While I worked on my plan, I gave 7-for-0 (I worked seven days and didn’t take a day off) because I knew the roads within my roadmap converged with dreams. I worked for a better ratio shortly, not in forty years. I controlled my destiny, and eventually, my time trade investment yielded a dividend of forty years. Now I do 0-for-7. I work zero days and get seven days of freedom.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions The Slowlane is a natural course correction from the Sidewalk evolving from responsibility and accountability. Wealth is best experienced when you’re young, vibrant, and able, not in the twilight of your life. The Slowlane is a plan that takes decades to succeed, requiring masterful political prowess in a corporate environment, frugality, and Wall Street wizardry. For the Slowlaner, Saturday and Sunday are the paychecks for Monday through Friday. The default return on your time in the Slowlane is negative 60%—5-for-2. The 5-for-2 trade inherent in the Slowlane is generally fixed and cannot be manipulated because job standards are five days a week. In the Slowlane, Lifestyle Servitude is created via ascetic saving and investing rituals, whereas Lifestyle Servitude from the Sidewalk evolves from conspicuous consumerism. The predisposed destination of the Slowlane is mediocrity. Life isn’t great, but with enough mental gymnastics, it isn’t so bad either.

Uncontrollable Limited Leverage (ULL) – Part 1 Why is ULL so important? To accumulate financial wealth, you need to attract and earn a large sum of money relative to the average person. Two things are absolutely required to do so: Control Leverage The Slowlane has neither, and that truth is exposed when you reverse engineer the strategy into its mathematical equivalent or its wealth universe.

Can you earn $50,000 one year and bank $50 million next year? Can you control anything about your job, including your measly 4% pay raise?

Wealth creation via compound interest requires the passing of time and lots of it. Like a job, compound interest or market investments such as stocks and indexed funds can’t be leveraged, nor can they be controlled. They rely on deficient math to create wealth.

A Slowlane guru preaches that a $10,000 investment grown at 15% will be worth over $2.5 million in 40 years!!! Hooray!!! What don’t they tell you? They don’t tell you that a 15% return year after year is impossible unless you invest with Bernie Madoff or Charles Ponzi. They don’t tell you that in 40 years, you’ll be dead, and if you’re not, you’ll be close. They don’t tell you that in 40 years, your $2.5 million will likely be worth $250,000 in today’s dollars and that a pack of gum will cost $6.00.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions Slowlane wealth is improbable due to Uncontrollable Limited Leverage (ULL). The first variable in the Slowlane wealth equation stems from a job that factors to intrinsic value, which is your nominal value for each unit of your life traded. Intrinsic value is the value of your time set by the marketplace and is measured in units of time, either hourly or yearly. In the Slowlane, intrinsic value (regardless of its time measurement) is numerically inhibited because there are only 24 hours in the day (for the hourly worker), and the average lifespan is 74 years (for the salaried worker). Like the Slowlaner’s primary income source (a job), the Slowlaner’s wealth acceleration vehicle (compound interest) is also pegged to time. Compound interest is mathematically futile and cannot be manipulated like a job. You cannot force-feed the market (or the economy) to give you phenomenal returns, year after year. Wealth cannot be accelerated asymmetrically when pegged to mathematics based on time. Time is your primordial fuel, and it should not be traded for money. Your lifeforce should not be an expendable resource for wealth because it is composed of time. Your mortality makes time mathematically retarded for wealth creation. If you don’t control the variables inherent in your wealth universe, you don’t control your financial plan.

People's best excuse for not having wealth is “I don’t have time.” Well, why don’t you have time? Because you have a job. Why do you have a job? Because you need one. Why do you need one? Because you have bills to pay. Why do you have bills to pay? Because you have debt. Why do you have debt? Oh yes, because you went to school for six years and have six figures in student loans.

5) The Danger of Your Lifestyle The Slowlane begs you to “settle for less” and live like an ascetic monk. Want to own an exotic car? Forget it. Want to live on a beach? Wishful thinking. Like to eat sushi three times per week? Sorry, not in the budget. If you cannot control your temptations of lifestyle improvement (a nicer home, a nicer car, a nicer meal out), the Slowlane replaces Lifestyle Servitude of consumerism, with Lifestyle Servitude of forced minimalism. Meanwhile, dissatisfaction drives higher. The Slowlane HOPES your “delayed gratification” moves to “no gratification.”

7) The Danger of the Sidewalk Frustrated Slowlaners often revert to the Sidewalk. Why? Hope over control. When you can’t control time, your job, or five days of your life each week, you feel powerless. Emotions of helplessness create an environment ripe for instant gratification and consumption-driven Lifestyle Servitude. A study published in 2008 by the Journal of Consumer Research found that when people feel powerless and out of control, they have a strong desire to buy things that convey high status. Why do they feel powerless? Simple. In the Slowlane, you relinquish control because time is in control, and the gates to the Sidewalk reopen. Hope is not a plan.

Resistance Is Futile When you perform an autopsy on the Slowlane, you see its true colors: It’s slow, it eats time, and it’s risky. When a Slowlaner realizes the plan isn’t working, he goes into overdrive. Overdrive in the Slowlane is like riding a child's tricycle and pedaling harder, expecting the three-wheeled vehicle to exceed is theoretical speed limits. Pedaling harder, or working harder, is not the problem—the problem is you saddled the wrong vehicle.  Yet, a Slowlaner will try to manipulate his weak mathematical universe by making the variables malleable.

A tricycle that has a top speed of 3 mph will always have a top speed of 3 mph, no matter HOW HARD YOU PEDAL! If you travel across the country at 3 mph, you’ll need forty years! The Slowlane is predisposed to mediocrity because the numbers are always mediocre. The Slowlane is risky because its variables are uncontrollable, and leverage is absent. ULL really means “ULL” never get rich. Yet, lifestyle is the one variable Slowlaners can effectively manipulate. Unfortunately, this quickly turns Slowlane life into a stale exhibition of misery. Yes, settle for less.

Hoodwinking expenses does not create wealth. Exploding income and controlling expenses create wealth.  For example, when I routinely earned over $100,000 per month, I accumulated wealth fast because I controlled and restricted my expenses. As my income went asymmetrical, expenses grew linearly and weren’t neglected. If my income increased by 100%, expenses only grew by 10%. I didn’t accumulate wealth because of expense dickery. Income explosion and relative expense containment created wealth.

Debt Perception: Debt is useful if it allows me to build and grow my system. Time Perception: Time is the most important asset I have, far exceeding money.  Education Perception: The moment you stop learning is the moment you stop growing. Constant expansion of knowledge and awareness is critical to my journey. Money Perception: Money is everywhere, and it’s extremely abundant. Money reflects how many lives I’ve touched. Money reflects the value I’ve created.  Primary Income Source: I earn income via my business systems and investments. Primary Wealth Accelerator: I make something from nothing. I give birth to assets and make them valuable to the marketplace. Other times, I take existing assets and add value to them. Wealth Perception: Build business systems for cash flow and asset valuation. Wealth Equation: Wealth = Net Profit + Asset Value Strategy: The more I help, the richer I become in time, money, and personal fulfillment. Destination: Lifetime passive income, either through business or investments. Responsibility & Control: Life is what I make it. My financial plan is my responsibility, and I choose how I react to my circumstances. Life Perception: My dreams are worth pursuing, no matter how outlandish, and I understand it will take time and money to make those dreams real.

After eight years, Chuma finishes his pyramid at age 26: three years to build the system and five years to reap the benefits of the system. The great Pharaoh is pleased and does as promised. He rewards Chuma with kingship and endows him with great riches. Chuma never has to work another day in his life. Meanwhile, Azur continues to dredge away at the same old routine. Lift rocks, waste time and money to get stronger, lift rocks, and get stronger. Sadly, Azur refuses to acknowledge his flawed strategy and endures the same old process: Carry heavy stones until you can lift no more . . . then get stronger so you can lift heavier stones.

Azur’s struggles resemble that of a Slowlaner; to get rich, you’re told to get stronger (spend money, return to school, and earn more in the job market), so you can lift heavier stones. The Fastlane is about building a better system, a better gadget, a better product, or a better “something” that will leverage your work. In the Slowlane, you are the source of heavy lifting, while in the Fastlane, you construct a system that does it for you.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions Producers are indigenous to the Fastlane roadmap. Producers are the minority, as are the rich, while consumers are the majority, as are the poor. When you succeed as a producer, you can consume anything you want. Fastlaners are producers, entrepreneurs, innovators, visionaries, and creators. A business does not make a Fastlane—some businesses are jobs in disguise. The Fastlane wealth equation is not bound by time, and its variables are unlimited and controllable.

1) Raise Units Sold by Increasing the Conversion Ratio A 1% increase from 12% to 13% would give me an instant raise of about $480 per day. That’s $14,400 per month. If I redesign the website, hit a home run, and get the conversion to 15%, I’ve expanded my income to over $43,000 PER MONTH. 2) Raise Units Sold by Increasing Web Traffic To raise profit, I can increase traffic. If I increase web users to my website from 12,000 to 15,000 and conversion stays at 12%, my daily income rises by $1,440 per day or $43,200 per month! Not likely? It happened! I would have traffic spikes where over 20,000 users would visit on some days. 3) Raise Unit Profit If I detect a weakness in supply for my service or improve value, I can raise prices and increase my unit profit. If my unit profit moves from $4 to $4.50, I raise my income to $10,800 per day from $8,000. That translates to an additional $84,000 per month! Is your mouth on the floor yet? Isn’t

Millionaires Create and Manipulate Assets (Asset Value) In a survey of 3,000 Penta-millionaires ($5 million net worth), the Harrison Group (HarrisonGroupInc.com) reported that almost all Penta-millionaires made their fortunes in a big lump sum after years. Worth repeating: a big lump sum, not “by saving 10% of his paycheck for 40 years.” “A big lump sum” is just another phrase for “asset value.”

The primary wealth accelerant of the rich boils down to one concept: Appreciable and controllable assets. This second component is called “Asset Value” within our Fastlane wealth equation. Asset value is simply the worth of any property you own that has marketplace value.

Slowlaners and Fastlaners have two antagonistic views of “assets.” Slowlaners and Sidewalkers buy and sell depreciating assets that decline over time. Cars, boats, electronics, designer clothes, gadgets, and sparkly bling to impress that newly divorced woman in the adjacent cubicle—these are all assets that lose value the moment your credit card is charged. Contrary to this, Fastlaners buy and sell appreciating assets: businesses, brands, cash flows, notes, intellectual property, licenses, inventions, patents, and real estate. As it relates to the Fastlane wealth equation, the power of “Asset Value” lies in your ability to control the variable in a virtually limitless fashion.

Any time an asset has sustainable profits, an industry multiplier governed by prevailing market conditions determines the asset’s value. Other people or companies will buy that asset based on the asset’s net profit multiplied by the assessed multiple. For example, if you own a manufacturing company that nets $100,000 and the average multiple for your industry is 6, your asset value is worth $600,000.

You already might be familiar with “multipliers.” Stocks trading on the public markets define each company's multiplier by the price-to-earnings ratio or PE. If a company’s stock trades at 10 times PE, investors purchase that company at a multiple of 10 times.

For example, in my webspace, industry multipliers ranged from 2 to 6. For this analysis, let’s use the middle: 4. This meant any time I increased my net profit, the value of my business grew by a minimum factor of 4, or 400%. 400%! Where can you get a return of 400% in today’s financial market? Are there any mutual funds paying 400%? Forget about today, how about ever? In effect, this puts a phenomenal wealth-building tool at your disposal. Since net income, profit, or earnings can determine asset value, I experienced asset growth of 400% every time I increased net profit. For every dollar I profited, the value of my company would increase by a factor of 4, or $4. If my net profit increased by $500,000 for the year, my company’s valuation would increase by $2 million.

When I repurchased my company, I paid $250,000. Then for the next several years, I manipulated the asset and increased its value. I expanded my customer base by 30%. I reduced expenses, improving profitability. I streamlined operations, which created passivity. I elevated “net income.” Over this process, my net income exploded and, with it, asset value. Then, subsequently, and after profiting millions passively, I put the company up for sale and entertained multimillion-dollar offers. I bought an asset for $250,000, appreciated and manipulated the variables, and sold it for millions.

Just like education, Fastlaners and Slowlaners leverage compound interest differently. Slowlaners (the middle-class) use compound interest to get wealthy, while Fastlaners (the rich) use it to create income and liquidity. Slowlaners start with $5; Fastlaners start with $5 million.

Compound interest pays me a lot of money. It’s a tool I use, and it’s a great passive income source. Yet, compound interest is not responsible for my wealth. This is critical. Fastlaners aren’t using compound interest to build wealth because it’s not in their wealth equation. The heavy lifting of wealth creation is left to their Fastlane business.

The Heart of the Problem As my income elevated, so did my cholesterol. The road of good living runs parallel to a cliff of gluttony. My doctor’s preferred method of attack was prescription drugs. I refused because I wanted to fix problems, not mask symptoms. If you approach wealth like a big pharmaceutical company and attack symptoms while neglecting problems, you will not succeed. Feeling tired? Take this pill. Want to lose weight? Another pill. The problems are ignored while the symptoms are addressed in recursive cycles. I refused cholesterol medication because it addressed the symptom, not the problem. My problem was poor diet; cholesterol was the symptom. If your car’s fuel tank had a small leak, how would you fix it? The symptomatic solver would increase his trips to the gas station to ensure a steady fuel inflow. The problematic solver plugs up the hole. One addresses the symptom (the gas tank leaks), while the other addresses the problem (a hole in the gas tank). While adding fuel addresses the symptom, it doesn’t solve the problem. When the behavior stops, the problem remains.

Andre’s life forever changed because of multiple treasonous choices. The choice to drink. The choice to drive. The choice to think, “I’m OK.” The series of choices are plentiful, and his exit strategy is clear. He doesn’t choose wisely. Welcome the DARE.

Steve McNair when his mistress allegedly shot him to death in a Nashville, Tennessee, condo. While he didn’t choose to be murdered, he chose to pursue the woman. He chose the relationship. He chose to cheat. He chose to act. You see, we aren’t just talking about ONE choice here, but many that made him partially (and unknowingly) complicit in the treason. His choices loaded the gun, but someone else pulled the trigger.

The Butterfly Effect Can you make a choice this instant that can forever alter the trajectory of your future? You can, and it can be the difference between poverty and wealth. When you make minor permutations (choices) that deviate from your initial conditions, profound effects transpire over time.

The Butterfly Effect Can you make a choice this instant that can forever alter the trajectory of your future? You can, and it can be the difference between poverty and wealth. When you make minor permutations (choices) that deviate from your initial conditions, profound effects transpire over time. Think of it like a golf club striking a golf ball. When the clubface hits the ball square, the ball goes straight and heads toward the hole. But when the clubface has rotated a fraction of one degree, the ball’s trajectory lands far off course. At impact, the divergence is minor, but as the ball travels further, it widens and widens until the gap is so large that getting back on track is nearly impossible. A wrong choice can set your trajectory off by only one degree today, but as the years pass, the error magnifies.

Think about it in terms of an asteroid on a collision course with Earth. When an asteroid is millions of miles out in space (representing your youthful choices), a simple one-degree change in trajectory will save the Earth from destruction. This is the power of horsepower. For us older folks, the asteroid is closer to Earth (and closer to our death), which weakens the potency of our choices. A one-degree change isn’t as effective, and it needs to be ten degrees for the same force.

Near the tree's trunk, the branches are thick, reflecting the decisions you’ve made early in life, while the top branches are thin, symbolizing decisions near the end of your life. Youthful choices radiate the most strength and fabricate the trunk of your tree. As the branches ascend topside through time, they get thinner and weaker. They don’t have enough power to bend the tree in new directions because the trunk is thick with age, experience, and reinforced habits.

At age sixteen, David ignites a smoke bomb in the school bus for a school prank, and fourteen children suffer smoke inhalation. Fortunately, those children recovered quickly, but David’s ten-day stay in juvenile detention forever thrusts David’s life down a different path. David meets Rudy, who teaches David the “rules” of the perfect burglary. This relationship forges David’s new career choice—thievery. After avoiding the law for seven years, David is caught, convicted, and sentenced to nine years in prison.

Wiping the Windshield Clean Starts with Language You can expose your mindset by examining the words in your language and your thoughts. Take, for example, this comment made on the Fastlane Forum: I got engaged last Friday! I had been struggling with this for some time but decided to give marriage one more try. She’s a great girl and deserves the best, and I think I can give it to her. When you read this statement, do you see assured success? Or pending failure? While I wish the man the best marriage, I see flaccid words that lack confidence: “Try,” “I think.” This language spells trouble. What would have convinced me otherwise? I got engaged last Friday! I had been struggling with this for some time, but I decided to get married for the last time. She’s a great girl and deserves the best, and I will give it to her. Notice the difference. One is flimsy, and the other is firm. Both seem to say the same thing, but one implies possible failure while the other implies committed success. Your internal language carries weight. If a brain surgeon told you before surgery, “I think I can operate on you, and I will try to succeed,” you should freak out and trade in your hospital gown for some eternal nighties. Altering your words and thought perceptions are akin to wiping your windshield clean and seeing beyond your bubble.

Get a pencil and paper. Make three columns on your paper, one headed “Factors” and the other two for each choice, “Detroit” and “Phoenix.” Second, what decision factors are essential in your decision? Weather? Schools? Cost of living? Being near family? Write down all aspects relevant to the decision, no matter how small. Write these factors in the “Factor” column. Your WADM would now look like this: Thirdly, next to each decision factor, weigh its importance to the decision from 1 through 10, with 10 being the most important. For example, you are seasonally depressed, so the weather is assigned a 10 in your matrix. Subsequently, your children are almost 18, so you decide that a sound school system isn’t a top priority, and it receives a 3. Do this for all factors. Now your WADM looks like this:

Being the youngest of three siblings, you can bet I was the subject of some vile comments. Fat, stupid, you name it. However, just because my brother called me an idiot for 12 years doesn’t make it my reality. Your past never equals your future unless you allow it. Think about a coin flip. No matter how many times it’s flipped, the next flip is always random. Probability cannot be attached to a future flip based on the past. Your past is the same. Just because you failed at five relationships doesn’t mean your next will fail, especially if you learn from them!

A Fastlane Forum member posted this: Go into a kindergarten class and ask the kids how many of them can sing. EVERY hand will go up. Fast-forward 13 years and ask the same class of seniors the same question. Only a few hands will go up. What changed? The kindergarten kids believed they could sing because no one had told them otherwise.

Escaping Human Headwind Bloviators People who don’t empower your goals are human headwind bloviators. They add friction to the journey. When you spout excitement over actions or ideas, bloviators react with doubt and disbelief and use conditioned talking points such as, “Oh, that won’t work,” “Someone is already doing it,” and “Why bother?” You might know them as “haters” or “dream stealers,” and you mustn’t listen.

Your friend Lucy who has a new job every three weeks, was caught forging checks and is only looking for a super-rich guy to carry her off into the sunset? Are these people you can count on? Are these the people you want to go to battle with? If not, you need to pick better warriors for your team. How? Join entrepreneur clubs, attend networking events, ally yourself with like-minders, get yourself around people who subscribe to a Fastlane, anything-is-possible mindset, and decide which warriors you want on your team. Read books and autobiographies of those who have the kind of success you want. Find a mentor. Join entrepreneur forums with a Fastlane mindset, like the Fastlane Forum!

One of my first girlfriends was A+ marriage material. But she fully subscribed to the Slowlane philosophy. She couldn’t understand why I was so earnest about being an entrepreneur. Our relationship soured as my failures grew, and the relationship eventually ended. This wasn’t anyone’s fault; we were just two different people on two different paths. Bad relationships are roadblocks to Fastlane success. They drain energy and dim dreams.

Dump the Junk in the Trunk!  If you race cars at the drag strip, you know that every ounce of weight counts. Racers remove everything nonessential to make the car as light as possible. This increases efficiency, speed, and performance, resulting in faster finishes. Unnecessary weight forces the vehicle to work harder. Yet we’re guilty of adding weight to our road trip to wealth. Our vehicle is burdened with junk-in-the-trunk that coerces us to work harder. And when you work harder long enough, it wears you out and breaks you down.

Our vehicle is burdened with junk-in-the-trunk that coerces us to work harder. And when you work harder long enough, it wears you out and breaks you down. This debilitating weight is parasitic debt. Parasitic debt is everything you owe the world. It is the excrement of Lifestyle Servitude. Your shiny new Infiniti financed at 60 monthly payments, your home mortgage financed over 30 years, your fancy designer clothes four months removed from out-of-fashion, and yes, even that insidious furniture that seemed like such a good idea at the time.

The Law of Chocolate Chip Cookies When I first moved out, I quickly learned the Law of Chocolate Chip Cookies: If the cookies don’t get into the grocery cart, they don’t get home. And if they don’t get home, they don’t get in my mouth. And if they don’t get in my mouth, they don’t transform into belly fat. Parasitic debt follows the same law. Control parasitic debt by controlling its source: instant gratification, a trait of the Sidewalk. The next time you feel compelled to buy some trinket at Macy’s, ask yourself: Will this be obsolete in six months and land in the garage with the rest of the junk? Will these stupid sequin jeans be relegated to the dusty side of the closet reserved for painting smocks in four months? Again, when you purchase the next hot fashion fad without being able to afford it, you open the floodgates to parasitic debt downstream to the Sidewalk.

Driving University: Listen to audiobooks or financial news radio while stuck in traffic. Traffic nuisances transformed into education. Exercise University: Absorb books, podcasts, and magazines while exercising at the gym. Exercise is transformed into education in between sets, on the treadmill, or on the stationary bike. Waiting University: Bring something to read with you when you anticipate a painful wait: Airports, doctor’s offices, and your state’s brutal motor vehicle department. Don’t sit there and twiddle your thumbs—learn! Toilet University: Never throne without reading something of educational value. Commit to learning something new daily by intentionally extending your “sit time” (even after you finish). Toilet University is the best place to change your oil since it occurs daily, and the time expenditure cannot be avoided. This means the return on your time investment is infinite! Toilet time transformed into education. Jobbing University: If you can, read during work downtimes. During my dead-job employment (driving limos, pizza delivery), I enjoyed significant “wait times” between jobs. I read while I waited for passengers, pizzas, and flower orders. I didn’t sit around playing pocket-poker; no, I read. If you can exploit dead time during your job, you are getting paid to learn. Dead-end jobs transformed into education. TV-Time University: Can’t wean yourself off the TV? No problem: put a television near your workspace and work on your Fastlane plan while the TV does its thing. While watching countless reruns of Star Trek, boldly going where no man has gone before, I simultaneously learned how to program websites. In fact, as I write this, I am watching the New Orleans Saints pummel the New England Patriots on Monday Night Football. Gridiron gluttony transformed into work and education.

A $50,000 oil change is as shocking as a $50,000 coaching program. Good seminars and coaching programs are under $1,000 and are given by respectable experts, practitioners, and seminar firms. Good seminars are educational and don’t come with a new Cadillac Escalade price. Bad seminars are hyped, high-pressure, and exploitative. Bad seminars are about making money and not about helping you.

If men and women are clinging to a politically correct sameness even in moments of intimacy, then sexual attraction disappears. I don’t mean just the desire for intercourse, but the juice of the entire relationship begins to dry up. The love may still be strong, the friendship may still be strong, but the sexual polarity fades, unless in moments of intimacy one partner is willing to play the masculine pole and one partner is willing to play the feminine.

Your sexual essence is your sexual core. If you have a more masculine sexual essence, you would, of course, enjoy staying home and playing with the kids, but deep down, you are driven by a sense of mission. You may not know your mission, but unless you discover this deep purpose and live it fully, your life will feel empty at its core, even if your intimate relationship and family life are full of love.

1 STOP HOPING FOR A COMPLETION OF ANYTHING IN LIFE Most men make the error of thinking that one day it will be done. They think, “If I can work enough, then one day I could rest.” Or, “One day my woman will understand something and then she will stop complaining.” Or, “I’m only doing this now so that one day I can do what I really want with my life.” The masculine error is to think that eventually things will be different in some fundamental way. They won’t. It never ends. As long as life continues, the creative challenge is to tussle, play, and make love with the present moment while giving your unique gift.

8 LEAN JUST BEYOND YOUR EDGE In any given moment, a man’s growth is optimized if he leans just beyond his edge, his capacity, his fear. He should not be too lazy, happily stagnating in the zone of security and comfort. Nor should he push far beyond his edge, stressing himself unnecessarily, unable to metabolize his experience. He should lean just slightly beyond the edge of fear and discomfort. Constantly. In everything he does.

Your fear is the sharpest definition of your self. You should know it. You should feel it virtually constantly. Fear needs to become your friend, so that you are no longer uncomfortable with it. Rather, primary fear shows you that you are at your edge. Staying with the fear, staying at your edge, allows real transformation to occur. Neither lazy nor aggressive, playing your edge allows you to perceive the moment with the least amount of distortion. You are willing to be with what is, rather than trying to escape it by pulling back from it, or trying to escape it by pushing beyond it into some future goal.

There is no essential difference between entering your woman’s feminine heart and entering fully into the world. Both forms of intercourse, sexual and worldly, require sensitivity, spontaneity, and a strong connection to deep truth in order to penetrate chaos and closure in a way that love prevails.

10 ENJOY YOUR FRIENDS’ CRITICISM A man’s capacity to receive another man’s direct criticism is a measure of his capacity to receive masculine energy. If he doesn’t have a good relationship to masculine energy (e.g., his father), then he will act like a woman and be hurt or defensive rather than make use of other men’s criticism.

Without knowing his life-purpose a man lives a weakened, impotent existence, perhaps eventually becoming even sexually impotent, or prone to mechanical and disinterested sex.

12 BE WILLING TO CHANGE EVERYTHING IN YOUR LIFE A man must be prepared to give 100 percent to his purpose, fulfill his karma or dissolve it, and then let go of that specific form of living. He must be capable of not knowing what to do with his life, entering a period of unknowingness and waiting for a vision or a new form of purpose to emerge. These cycles of strong specific action followed by periods of not knowing what the hell is going on are natural for a man who is shedding layers of karma in his relaxation into truth.

13 DON’T USE YOUR FAMILY AS AN EXCUSE If a man never discovers his deepest purpose, or if he permanently compromises it and uses his family as an excuse for doing so, then his core becomes weakened and he loses depth and presence. His woman loses trust and sexual polarity with him, even though he may be putting much energy into parenting their children and doing the housework. A man should, of course, be a full participant in caring for children and the household. But if he gives up his deepest purpose to do so, ultimately, everyone suffers.

15 STOP HOPING FOR YOUR WOMAN TO GET EASIER A woman often seems to test her man’s capacity to remain unperturbed in his truth and purpose. She tests him to feel his freedom and depth of love, to know that he is trustable. Her tests may come in the form of complaining, challenging him, changing her mind, doubting him, distracting him, or even undermining his purpose in a subtle or not so subtle way. A man should never think his woman’s testing is going to end and his life will get easier. Rather, he should appreciate that she does these things to feel his strength, integrity, and openness. Her desire is for his deepest truth and love. As he grows, so will her testing.

16 WOMEN ARE NOT LIARS “Keeping your word” is a masculine trait, in men or women. A person with a feminine essence may not keep her word, yet it is not exactly “lying.” In the feminine reality, words and facts take a second place to emotions and the shifting moods of relationship. When she says, “I hate you,” or “I’ll never move to Texas,” or “I don’t want to go to the movies,” it is often more a reflection of a transient feeling-wave than a well-considered stance with respect to events and experience. On the other hand, the masculine means what it says. A man’s word is his honor. The feminine says what it feels. A woman’s word is her true expression in the moment.

A woman with a more feminine sexual essence will say she loves you one moment, and then, when you have done something you are not even aware of, she will say she hates you. This is the beauty of the feminine; to her, the masculine grid of words and events is less relevant than the fluidity of relationship and feeling.

The trouble with these students was not that they were dumb, or lacking in basic aptitudes. The trouble was an inadequate self-image (“I don’t have a mathematical mind”; “I’m just naturally a poor speller”). They “identified” with their mistakes and failures. Instead of saying “I failed that test” (factual and descriptive), they concluded, “I am a failure.” Instead of saying “I flunked that subject,” they said, “I am a flunk-out.”

This self-image is our own conception of the “sort of person I am.” It has been built up from our own beliefs about ourselves. But most of these beliefs about ourselves have unconsciously been formed from our past experiences, our successes and failures, our humiliations, our triumphs, and the way other people have reacted to us, especially in early childhood.

Such “imaginary ugliness” is not at all uncommon. A recent survey of college co-eds showed that 90 percent were dissatisfied in some way with their appearance. If the words “normal” and “average” mean anything at all, it is obvious that 90 percent of our population cannot be “abnormal” or “different” or “defective” in appearance. Yet similar surveys have shown that approximately the same percentage of our general population finds some reasoning to be ashamed of their body image. These people react just as if they suffered from an actual disfigurement. They feel the same shame. They develop the same fears and anxieties.

To really “live,” that is, to find life reasonably satisfying, you must have an adequate and realistic self-image that you can live with. You must find your self acceptable to “you.” You must have a wholesome self-esteem. You must have a self that you can trust and believe in. You must have a self that you are not ashamed to “be,” and one that you can feel free to express creatively, rather than hide or cover up. You must have a self that corresponds to reality, so that you can function effectively in a real world. You must know yourself—both your strengths and your weaknesses—and be honest with yourself concerning both. Your self-image must be a reasonable approximation of “you,” being neither more than you are nor less than you are.

Today I am more convinced than ever that what each of us really wants, deep down, is more life. Happiness, success, peace of mind, or whatever your own conception of supreme good may be, is experienced in its essence as more life. When we experience expansive emotions of happiness, self-confidence, and success, we enjoy more life. And to the degree that we inhibit our abilities, frustrate our God-given talents, and allow ourselves to suffer anxiety, fear, self-condemnation, and self-hate, we literally choke off the life force available to us and turn our backs on the gift which our Creator has made. To the degree that we deny the gift of life, we embrace death.

There is within each one of us a “life instinct,” which is forever working toward health, happiness, and all that makes for more life for the individual.

This Creative Mechanism within you is impersonal.

The goals that our own Creative Mechanism seeks to achieve are mental images, or mental pictures, which we create by the use of imagination. The key goal-image is our self-image. Our self-image prescribes the limits for the accomplishment of any particular goals. It prescribes the “area of the possible.” Like any other servo-mechanism, our Creative Mechanism works on information and data that we feed into it (our thoughts, beliefs, interpretations). Through our attitudes and interpretations of situations, we “describe” the problem to be worked on.

The Success Instinct A squirrel does not have to be taught how to gather nuts. Nor does it need to learn that it should store them for winter. A squirrel born in the spring has never experienced winter. Yet in the fall of that year it can be observed busily storing nuts to be eaten during the winter months when there will be no food to be gathered. A bird does not need to take lessons in nest-building. Nor does it need to take courses in navigation. Yet birds do navigate thousands of miles, sometimes over open sea. They have no newspapers or TV to give them weather reports, no books written by explorer or pioneer birds to map out for them the warm areas of the earth. Nonetheless the bird “knows” when cold weather is imminent and the exact location of a warm climate even though it may be thousands of miles away. In attempting to explain such things, we usually say that animals have certain instincts that guide them. Analyze all such instincts and you will find they assist the animal to successfully cope with its environment. In short, animals have a Success Instinct.

We often overlook the fact that man, too, has a Success Instinct, much more marvelous and much more complex than that of any animal. Our Creator did not shortchange man. On the other hand, man was especially blessed in this regard. Animals cannot select their goals. Their goals (self-preservation and procreation) are preset, so to speak. And their success mechanism is limited to these built-in goal-images, which we call “instincts.” Man, on the other hand, has something animals don’t: Creative Imagination. Thus man of all creatures is more than a creature, he is also a creator. With his imagination he can formulate a variety of goals. Man alone can direct his Success Mechanism by the use of imagination, or imaging ability.

1. Your built-in Success Mechanism must have a goal or “target.” This goal, or target, must be conceived of as “already in existence—now” either in actual or potential form. It operates by either (1) steering you to a goal already in existence or (2) “discovering” something already in existence. 2. The automatic mechanism is teleological, that is, it operates or must be oriented to “end results” goals. Do not be discouraged because the “means whereby” may not be apparent. It is the function of the automatic mechanism to supply the means whereby when you supply the goal. Think in terms of the end result, and the means whereby will often take care of themselves. 3. Do not be afraid of making mistakes, or of temporary failures. All servo-mechanisms achieve a goal by negative feedback, or by going forward, making mistakes, and immediately correcting course. 4. Skill learning of any kind is accomplished by trial and error, mentally correcting aim after an error, until a “successful” motion, movement, or performance has been achieved. After that, further learning, and continued success, is accomplished by forgetting the past errors, and remembering the successful response, so that it can be imitated. 5. You must learn to trust your Creative Mechanism to do its work and not “jam it” by becoming too concerned or too anxious as to whether it will work or not, or by attempting to force it by too much conscious effort. You must “let it” work, rather than “make it” work. This trust is necessary because your Creative Mechanism operates below the level of consciousness, and you cannot “know” what is going on beneath the surface. Moreover, its nature is to operate spontaneously according to present need. Therefore, you have no guarantees in advance. It comes into operation as you act and as you place a demand on it by your actions. You must not wait to act until you have proof—you must act as if it is there, and it will come through. “Do the thing and you will have the power,” said Emerson.

The fact that this breakthrough came from the work of physicists and mathematicians should not surprise us. Any breakthrough in science is likely to come from outside the system. “Experts” are the most thoroughly familiar with the developed knowledge inside the prescribed boundaries of a given science. Any new knowledge must usually come from the outside—not from “experts,” but from what someone has defined as an “inpert.” Pasteur was not an MD. The Wright brothers were not aeronautical engineers but bicycle mechanics. Einstein, properly speaking, was not a physicist but a mathematician.

If the student could be induced to change his self-definition, his learning ability should also change. This proved to be the case. One student, who misspelled 55 words out of 100 and flunked so many subjects that he lost credit for a year, became one of the best spellers in the school and made a general average of 91 in the next year. A boy who was dropped from one college because of poor grades entered Columbia and became a straight “A” student. A girl who had flunked Latin four times, after three talks with the school counselor, finished with a grade of 84. A boy who was told by a testing bureau that he had no aptitude for English won honorable mention the next year for a literary prize. The trouble with these students was not that they were dumb, or lacking in basic aptitudes. The trouble was an inadequate self-image (“I don’t have a mathematical mind”; “I’m just naturally a poor speller”). They “identified” with their mistakes and failures. Instead of saying “I failed that test” (factual and descriptive), they concluded, “I am a failure.” Instead of saying “I flunked that subject,” they said, “I am a flunk-out.”

New Scientific Insights into “Subconscious Mind” The new science of cybernetics has furnished us with convincing proof that the so-called subconscious mind is not a “mind” at all, but a mechanism—a goal-striving “servo-mechanism” consisting of the brain and nervous system, which is used by, and directed by the mind.

In order to direct your servo-mechanism toward success instead of failure, all you need is one experience that made you feel good about yourself. Remembering and then using that modest accomplishment will be instrumental in improving your self-image. You do not need a huge success experience to alter your self-image for the better. You do not need an experience that is a mirror of what you’re trying to create or accomplish. All you need is an experience like tying your shoe or learning to write your name for the first time, wherein you can say, “Yes, I’m glad I learned that skill. Yes, I remember the first day I could do it. Yes, I was happy.” This one memory, this one positive experience, no matter how long ago it took place, is all you need to begin changing the course of your life in the present.

When certain areas of the cortex were touched, patients did not merely “remember” past experiences, they “relived” them, experiencing as very real all the sights, sounds, and sensations of the original experience. It was just as if past experiences had been recorded on a tape recorder and played back. It is still a mystery how a mechanism as small as the human brain can store such a vast amount of information.

The means by which your Success Mechanism works often take care of themselves and do so effortlessly when you supply the goal to your brain. The precise action steps will come to you without stress, tension, or worry about how you are going to accomplish the result you seek. Many people make the mistake of interfering with their Success Mechanism by demanding a how before a goal is clearly established. After you’ve formed a mental image of the goal you seek to create, the how will come to you—not before. Remain calm and relaxed and the answers will arrive. Any attempt to force the ideas to come will not work. As Brian Tracy wrote, “In all mental workings, effort defeats itself.”

Research Quarterly reported an experiment on the effects of mental practice on improving skill in sinking basketball free throws. One group of students that practiced throwing the ball every day for 20 days was scored on the first and last days. A second group was scored on the first and last days but engaged in no sort of practice in between. A third group was scored on the first day then spent 20 minutes a day imagining that they were throwing the ball into the hoop. When they missed, they would imagine that they corrected their aim accordingly. The first group, which practiced 20 minutes every day, improved in scoring 24 percent. The second group, which had no sort of practice, showed no improvement. The third group, which practiced in their imagination, improved in scoring 23 percent! I was asked by Randy Sullivan, a coach at a pitching academy, to help him with the “mental game” for his high school and college baseball players, many of whom had a goal to throw the ball 90 miles per hour. Randy said, “When an athlete is within a few miles per hour of the Promised Land, crossing the line is more mental than physical.” I witnessed many athletes struggle with all their might to throw 90 miles per hour—and fall short. Yet, after I taught these athletes a number of mental imagery and relaxation exercises, they were able to relax their bodies and hit 90 for the first time. Afterward, their self-images usually adjusted to the rate of velocity and hitting 90 was no longer difficult. Eighteen months after implementing the Psycho-Cybernetics techniques, the number of players who broke 90 miles per hour at Randy’s facility skyrocketed from 18 to 98.

How Imagination Practice Won a Chess Championship Reader’s Digest reprinted an article from The Rotarian by Joseph Phillips called “Chess: They Call It a Game,” in which Phillips tells how the great chess champion Capablanca was so superior to all competition that it was believed by experts that he would never be beaten in match play. Yet he lost the championship to a rather obscure player, Alekhine, who had given no hint that he even posed a serious threat to the great Capablanca. The chess world was stunned by the upset, which today would be comparable to a Golden Gloves finalist defeating the heavyweight champion of the world. Phillips tells us that Alekhine had trained for the match very much like a boxer conditioning himself for a fight. He retired to the country, cut out smoking and drinking, and did calisthenics. “For three months, he played chess only in his mind, building up steam for the moment when he would meet the champion.”

Johnny Bulla, the well-known professional golfer, wrote an article in which he said that having a clear mental image of just where you wanted the ball to go and what you wanted it to do was more important than form in golf. Most of the pros, said Bulla, have one or more serious flaws in their form. Yet they manage to shoot good golf. It was Bulla’s theory that if you would picture the end result—see the ball going where you wanted it to go—and have the confidence to know that it was going to do what you wanted, your subconscious would take over and direct your muscles correctly. If your grip was wrong, and your stance not in the best form, your subconscious would still take care of that by directing your muscles to do whatever was necessary to compensate for the error in form.

Cybernetics regards the human brain, nervous system, and muscular system as a highly complex servo-mechanism: an automatic goal-seeking machine that “steers” its way to a target or goal by use of feedback data and stored information, automatically correcting course when necessary. As stated earlier, this concept does not mean that you are a machine, but that your physical brain and body functions as a machine that you operate.

If we really believe in an all-wise, all-powerful, all-loving Creator, then we are in a position to draw some logical conclusions about that which he has created—man. In the first place such an all-wise and all powerful Creator would not turn out inferior products, any more than a master painter would paint inferior canvases. Such a Creator would not deliberately engineer his product to fail, any more than a manufacturer would deliberately build failure into an automobile. The fundamentalists tell us that man’s chief purpose and reason for living is to “glorify God,” and the humanists tell us that man’s primary purpose is to “express himself fully.”

go back into your past and find a “successful” memory, an occasion when you did something well. Again, this could be as simple as tying your shoes for the first time or writing your name in school. When it happened is irrelevant. How “big” the success was doesn’t matter either. All that matters is that the memory triggers a positive, happy, feel-good experience in you right now. Replay and relive the positive memory, then go into the future and picture how you want to be with the same feeling you felt in the past. Add emotion to what you’re seeing in your mind’s eye. If you find your mind wandering, don’t get upset or be hard on yourself. Relax and picture again. Each time your mind wanders, bring yourself back. No worries.

The Case of the Hypnotized Salesman In the book Secrets of Successful Selling, John D. Murphy tells how Elmer Wheeler used Lecky’s theory to increase the earnings of a certain salesman: Elmer Wheeler had been called in as a sales consultant to a certain firm. The sales manager called his attention to a very remarkable case. A certain salesman always managed to make almost exactly $5,000 per year, regardless of the territory they assigned him or the commission he was paid. Because this salesman had done well in a rather small territory, he had been given a larger and much better one. But the next year his commission amounted to almost the same amount as that he had made in the smaller one—$5,000. The following year the company increased the commission paid to all salesmen, but this salesman still managed to make only $5,000. He was then assigned one of the company’s poorest territories—and again made the usual $5,000. Wheeler had a talk with this salesman and found that the trouble was not in the territory but in the salesman’s own evaluation of himself. He thought of himself as a $5,000-per-year man and as long as he held that concept of himself, outside conditions didn’t seem to matter much. When he was assigned a poor territory, he worked hard to make that $5,000. When he was assigned a good territory, he found all sorts of excuses to coast when the $5,000 was in sight. Once, when the goal had been reached, he got sick and was unable to work anymore that year, although doctors could find nothing wrong with him and he miraculously recovered by the first of the next year.

Our errors, mistakes, failures, and sometimes even our humiliations, were necessary steps in the learning process. However, they were meant to be means to an end—and not an end in themselves. When they have served their purpose, they should be forgotten. If we consciously dwell on the error, or consciously feel guilty about the error and keep berating ourselves because of it, then—unwittingly—the error or failure itself becomes the “goal” that is consciously held in imagination and memory. The unhappiest of mortals is that man who insists on reliving the past, over and over in imagination—continually criticizing himself for past mistakes—continually condemning himself for past sins.

Continually criticizing yourself for past mistakes and errors does not help matters, but on the other hand tends to perpetuate the very behavior you would change. Memories of past failures can adversely affect present performance, if we dwell on them and foolishly conclude, “I failed yesterday; therefore, it follows that I will fail again today.” However, this does not prove that unconscious reaction patterns have any power in themselves to repeat and perpetuate themselves, or that all buried memories of failure must be eradicated before behavior can be changed. If we are victimized, it is by our conscious, thinking mind and not by the “unconscious.” For it is with the thinking part of our personality that we draw conclusions, and select the “goal images” that we shall concentrate upon.

The sentence by Myers explained that the talents and abilities displayed by hypnotic subjects were due to a “purgation of memory” of past failures while in the hypnotic state. If this were possible under hypnosis, Miss Brande asked herself—if ordinary people carried around within themselves talents, abilities, powers that were held in and not used merely because of memories of past failures—why couldn’t a person in the wakeful state use these same powers by ignoring past failures and “acting as if it were impossible to fail”? She determined to try it. She would act on the assumption that the powers and abilities were there—and that she could use them—if only she would go ahead and “ACT AS IF,” instead of in a tentative half-hearted way. Within a year her production as a writer had increased many times and so had her sales. A rather surprising result was that she discovered a talent for public speaking, became much in demand as a lecturer—and enjoyed it, whereas previously she had not only shown no talent for lecturing, but disliked it intensely.

To root out the belief that is responsible for your feeling and behavior—ask yourself, “Why?” Is there some task that you would like to do, some channel in which you would like to express yourself, but you hang back feeling that “I can’t”? Ask yourself, “Why?” “Why do I believe that I can’t?” Then ask yourself, “Is this belief based on an actual fact or on an assumption—or a false conclusion?” Then ask yourself the questions: 1. Is there any rational reason for such a belief? 2. Could it be that I am mistaken in this belief? 3. Would I come to the same conclusion about some other person in a similar situation? 4. Why should I continue to act and feel as if this were true if there is no good reason to believe it? Don’t just pass these questions by casually. Wrestle with them. Think hard on them. Get emotional about them. Can you see that you have cheated yourself and sold yourself short—not because of a “fact”—but only because of some stupid belief? If so, try to arouse some indignation, or even anger. Indignation and anger can sometimes act as liberators from false ideas.

Picture to yourself what you would like to be and have, and assume for the moment that such things might be possible. Arouse a deep desire for these things. Become enthusiastic about them. Dwell on them—and keep going over them in your mind. Your present negative beliefs were formed by thought plus feelings. Generate enough emotion, or deep feeling, and your new thoughts and ideas will cancel them out. If you will analyze this, you will see that you are using a process you have often used before—worry! The only difference is you change your goals from negative to positive. When you worry, you first of all picture some undesirable future outcome, or goal, very vividly in your imagination. You use no effort or willpower. But you keep dwelling on the “end result.” You keep thinking about it—dwelling on it—picturing it to yourself as a “possibility.” You play with the idea that it “might happen.” This constant repetition, and thinking in terms of “possibilities,” makes the end result appear more and more “real” to you. After time, appropriate emotions are automatically generated—fear, anxiety, discouragement—all these are appropriate to the undesirable end result you are worrying about. Now change the “goal picture”—and you can as easily generate “good emotions.” Constantly picturing to yourself, and dwelling on, a desirable end result will also make the possibility seem more real—and again appropriate emotions of enthusiasm, cheerfulness, encouragement, and happiness will automatically be generated. “In forming good emotional habits, and in breaking bad ones,” said Dr. Knight Dunlap, “we have to deal primarily with thought and thought habits. ‘As a man thinketh in his heart so is he.’”

What Rational Thought Can and Cannot Do Remember that your automatic mechanism can as easily function as a Failure Mechanism as it can as a Success Mechanism, depending on the data you give it to process, and the goals you set for it. It is basically a goal-striving mechanism. The goals it works on are up to you.

Now all you need to do is bring the same person who speaks easily with friends into the room where you will then speak openly before a large crowd of perceived friends.

Decide What You Want—Not What You Don’t Want It is the job of conscious rational thought to decide what you want, select the goals you wish to achieve—and concentrate on these rather than on what you do not want. To spend time and effort concentrating on what you do not want is not rational.

It is not the job of your conscious rational mind, however, to create or to “do” the job at hand. We get into trouble when we either neglect to use conscious thinking in the way that it is meant to be used, or when we attempt to use it in a way that it was never meant to be used. We cannot squeeze creative thought out of the Creative Mechanism by making conscious effort. We cannot “do” the job to be done by making strained conscious efforts.

We cannot squeeze creative thought out of the Creative Mechanism by making conscious effort. We cannot “do” the job to be done by making strained conscious efforts. And because we try and cannot, we become concerned, anxious, frustrated. The automatic mechanism is unconscious. We cannot see the wheels turning. We cannot know what is taking place beneath the surface. And because it works spontaneously in reacting to present and current needs, we can have no intimation or certified guarantee in advance that it will come up with the answer. We are forced into a position of trust. And only by trusting and acting do we receive signs and wonders. In short, conscious, rational thought selects the goal, gathers information, concludes, evaluates, estimates, and starts the wheels in motion. It is not, however, responsible for results. We must learn to do our work, act on the best assumptions available, and leave results to take care of themselves.

Don’t Be Too Careful Yet that is precisely what modern man tries to do: solve all his problems by conscious thought. Jesus said, “Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?” Dr. Norbert Wiener tells us that man cannot even perform such a simple operation as picking up a pen from a table by conscious thought or “will.” Because modern man does depend almost entirely on his forebrain, he becomes too careful, too anxious, and too fearful of “results,” and the advice of Jesus to “take no thought for the morrow,” or of St. Paul to be “careful in nothing,” is regarded as impractical nonsense.

The Secret of Creative Thinking and Creative Doing Proof of the fact that what we have been saying is true can be seen in the experience of writers, inventors, and other creative workers. Invariably, they tell us that creative ideas are not consciously thought out by forebrain thinking, but come automatically, spontaneously, and somewhat like a bolt out of the blue, when the conscious mind has let go of the problem and is engaged in thinking of something else.

All the evidence points to the conclusion that in order to receive an “inspiration” or a “hunch,” the person must first of all be intensely interested in solving a particular problem, or securing a particular answer. He must think about it consciously, gather all the information he can on the subject, consider all the possible courses of action. And above all, he must have a burning desire to solve the problem. But, after he has defined the problem, sees in his imagination the desired end result, secured all the information and facts that he can, then additional struggling, fretting, and worrying over it does not help, but seems to hinder the solution.

“Ideas, I find, come most readily when you are doing something that keeps the mind alert without putting too much strain upon it. Shaving, driving a car, sawing a plank, or fishing or hunting, for instance. Or engaging with some friend in stimulating conversation.

Many creators report that they get their best ideas either in the shower, while walking along the beach, or otherwise being in or around water. Perhaps the “flow” of water leads to the flow of ideas. The other “activity” that often leads to creative insights is sleeping. If you have a question you’d like an answer to, or a project you’re working on that you’d like to accomplish with greater ease, you can instruct your mind before going to bed to be open to useful information and to remember it upon awakening. Keeping a notepad and pen on your nightstand to record the insights as they come is a good idea.

When you set a goal, it’s very important to keep in mind that most of the time you will be in “journey mode.” This means you will be focused on the process and the actions you need to take to get where you want to go—most of the time. If your goal is to climb Mount Everest, and you are only thinking about being at the top, you “jam” your success mechanism in the present. You’ve got to take care of each step along the way. Focus on the journey the majority of the time—and occasionally (once or twice per day when you visualize) tune into the goal. Then get back into journey mode and simply turn your goal over to your subconscious or Success Mechanism, to guide you there without effort. People who want to improve their financial situation must heed the same advice. If you continually obsess about where you are as well as where you want to be financially, you’re less likely to get there. Program the goal—then get busy on the process—and if you don’t know the process yet, give yourself space to allow the process of “how” to come to you. The “how” will come to you when you’re relaxed—not when you’re tense or trying to force your way through the process. Five

If a bull reversal bar has a large tail at the top or a bear reversal bar has a large tail at the bottom, the Countertrend traders lost conviction going into the close of the bar, and the Countertrend trade should only be taken if the body looks reasonably strong and the price action is supportive (like a second entry).

In Figure 1.5, Reversal Bar 1 largely overlaps the four prior bars, indicating a two-sided market so there was nothing to reverse. This is not a long setup bar. Figure 1.5 Reversal Bars in Sideways Markets Must Be Analyzed in Context Reversal Bar 2 is an excellent bear signal bar because it reverses the breakout of Reversal Bar 1 (there are trapped longs here off that bull reversal bar breakout) and it also reverses a breakout above the bear trendline down from the high of the day.

Although most large trend bars that are With Trend in a trend are strong, if a bar is unusually large, it often represents a climactic exhaustion. For example, in a bull, it often means that the last buyers bought. If there are no more buyers, the market will go down. Any standard reversal setup can serve as a signal bar, but a second entry with a strong reversal bar is always the safest setup when trading Countertrend.

It’s an offer you present to the marketplace that cannot be compared to any other product or service available, combining an attractive promotion, an unmatchable value proposition, a premium price, and an unbeatable guarantee with a money model (payment terms) that allows you to get paid to get new customers . . . forever removing the cash constraint on business growth.

Here’s the key takeaway from all this: a business does the same work in both cases (with a commoditized or a Grand Slam Offer). The fulfillment is the same. But if one business uses a Grand Slam Offer and another uses a “commodity” offer, the Grand Slam Offer makes that business appear as if it has a totally different product — and that means a value-driven, versus price-driven, purchase.

If you have a “commodity” offer, you will compete on price (having a price-driven purchase versus a value-driven purchase). Your Grand Slam Offer, however, forces a prospect to stop and think differently to assess the value of your differentiated product.

We want to make an offer that’s so different that you can skip the awkward explanation of why your product is different from everyone else’s (which, if they have to ask, then they are probably too ignorant to understand the explanation) and instead just have the offer do that work for you. That’s the Grand Slam Offer way. Let’s dive in to see the contrast in sales numbers.

The degree of the pain will be proportional to the price you will be able to charge (more on this in the Value Equation chapter). When they hear the solution to their pain, and inversely, what their life would look like without this pain, they should be drawn to your solution. I have a saying I use to train sales teams “The pain is the pitch.” If you can articulate the pain a prospect is feeling accurately, they will almost always buy what you are offering. A prospect must have a painful problem for us to solve and charge money for our solution.

Purchasing Power A friend of mine had a very good system for helping people improve their resumes to get more job interviews. He was great at it. But try as he did, he just could not get people to pay for his services. Why? Because they were all unemployed! This, again, may seem obvious. But he thought, “These people are easy to target. They’re in massive pain. There are plenty of them, and it's constantly adding new people. This is a great market!”

4) Growing Growing markets are like a tailwind. They make everything move forward faster. Declining markers are like headwinds. They make all efforts harder. This was Lloyd's example.

You must stick with whatever you pick long enough to have trial and error. You will fail. In fact, you will fail until you succeed. But you will fail far longer if you keep changing who you market to, because you must start over from the beginning each time. So, pick then commit. Riches Are In The Niches The other reason to commit to the niche is because of how much more you will make. Simply put, niching down will make you far more money.

In essence, raising your prices can directly enhance the value you provide. What’s more, the higher the price, the more allure your product or service has. People want to buy expensive things. They just need a reason. And the goal isn’t just to be slightly above the market price — the goal is to be so much higher that a consumer thinks to themselves, “This is so much more expensive, there must be something entirely different going on here.”

One final point I want to drive home: if you offer a service where a customer must do something in order to achieve the result, or solve the problem you say you solve, they must be invested. The more invested they are, the more likely they are to achieve a positive result. Therefore, it follows that if you care about your customers, you should get them as invested as humanly possible. Ideally, this means pricing your services or product in such a way that it stings a little when they buy. That sting will force and focus their attention and their investment in your product or service. Those who pay the most, pay the most attention.

But I know this isn’t easy, and it shouldn’t be. Your product must deliver.  So many wish to shortcut the real work. Do that and you will fail. In the real world, to have the “gonads” to charge big ticket prices, you must outwork your self doubt. You must be so confident in your delivery, because you have done it so many times, that you know that this person will succeed. Experience is what gives you the conviction to ask for someone’s entire year’s salary as payment. You must believe so deeply in your solution that when you look at yourself in the mirror at night, alone, your conviction remains unshakable.

As you can see from the picture, there are four primary drivers of value. Two of the drivers (on top), you will seek to increase. The other two (on the bottom), you will seek to decrease. (1)  (Yay) The Dream Outcome (Goal: Increase) (2)  (Yay) Perceived Likelihood of Achievement (Goal: Increase) (3)  (Boo) Perceived Time Delay Between Start and Achievement (Goal: Decrease) (4)  (Boo) Perceived Effort & Sacrifice (Goal: Decrease)

The Grand Slam Offer only becomes valuable once the prospect perceives the increase in likelihood of achievement, perceives the decrease in time delay, and perceives the decrease in effort and sacrifice. A prime example of this happened in the London tunnel system. The biggest increase in rider satisfaction (aka value) was never from faster trains to decrease wait times. Instead, it was from a simple dotted map that showed them when the next train was coming and how long they had to wait. The dotted map, which only cost a few million dollars, decreased the riders’ perception of time delay and sacrifice (being bored waiting) more than actually making the trains faster (which costs billions of dollars to do). Isn’t that cool? This is how we need to think about our products.

Step #2: List Problems Next, I wrote down all the things people struggled with and their limiting thoughts around them. When listing out problems, think about what happens immediately before and immediately after someone uses your product/service. What's the “next” thing they need help with? These are all the problems. Think about it in insane detail.

Step #3: Solutions List Now that we have our dream outcome and all the obstacles that will get in someone’s way, it’s time to define our solutions and list them out. Creating the solutions list has two steps. First, we are going to transform our problems into solutions. Second, we are going to name these solutions. That’s it. So let’s take a look at our list of problems from earlier. What we’re going to do is simply turn them into solutions by thinking, “What would I need to show someone to solve this problem?” Then we are going to reverse each element of the obstacle into solution-oriented language. This is copywriting 101. It’s beyond the scope of this book to get into, but simply adding “how to” then reversing the problem will give most people new to this process a great place to start.

It is that belief that cements a company culture and attracts talent committed to the firm's mission. That same belief, however, can imprison us. It becomes difficult to embrace change when your very heart and soul are wedded to what you are doing. Ironically, the more committed we are to what we do, the more challenging it becomes to make the changes needed to stay ahead.

Importantly, the prediction machine also evolved to fine-tune its actions based on particular experiences, through a learning process called conditioning. If you are taking a placebo painkiller expecting it to be morphine, the release of endogenous opioids will be far stronger if you have already taken morphine in the past, for example. Similarly, the placebo-triggered release of dopamine will be far stronger if someone has already taken a Parkinson’s drug – and a placebo to reduce transplant rejection will be more effective if someone has already taken a relevant immunosuppressant.

In an extraordinary experiment of this kind, researchers at Stanford University’s Mind & Body Lab helped treat a group of children and adolescents with severe peanut allergy. The patients were all undergoing ‘oral immunotherapy’, which involved gradually exposing the body to larger doses of peanut protein over a six-month period. All being well, the patient should become less and less sensitive to the allergen, until they can eventually eat a whole peanut without a severe reaction; but the therapy itself can sometimes result in unpleasant feelings, such as hives, an itchy mouth, nasal congestion and stomach pain. Besides being a source of immediate discomfort, these side effects often feel like the start of a full-blown allergic reaction, leading to increased anxiety about the treatment and a relatively high dropout rate. In reality, the side effects tend to remain rather mild – and rather than being the start of a dangerous over-reaction, they can be seen as a sign that the immune system is responding to the stimulus, which is an essential step in the process of desensitisation.

The first was the amount of stress they had been experiencing recently: employees with marital difficulties or family problems were more likely to be affected than those with stable circumstances. The second was their connection to the other victims: if they personally knew another sufferer, and had interacted with them regularly, they were more likely to be struck down.

More generally, Zahrt and Crum’s studies suggest that we should avoid ‘upward comparisons’, constantly judging ourselves against the people who are fitter than us. While there’s nothing wrong with a bit of aspirational thinking, it can easily turn into feelings of inadequacy, as we come to form more negative expectations of our fitness. Such perceptions may then reduce the benefits of our workouts.

Instagram and TikTok are full of ‘fitspiration’ or #fitspo accounts, with Photoshopped images of toned bodies working out. The videos and photos are meant to be motivational, but a study published in 2020 suggests they do more harm than good. The participants (all female undergraduates in Adelaide) were first asked to scroll through a set of images – either attractive shots of exotic travel locations or 18 pictures of fitness gurus completing their workouts. The participants then spent 10 minutes on a treadmill, exercising at the speed of their choice, and completed a series of questionnaires about their feelings. Those viewing the fitspiration images suffered on almost every measure. They had worse body image and experienced greater feelings of fatigue during exercise; rather than experiencing the ‘runner’s high’, they were in a significantly worse mood following the workout compared to those who had seen the travel pictures.35

And the resulting sense of inadequacy had rendered the exercise more arduous and less enjoyable – completely negating any of the claimed motivational benefits.

To see whether his memory deficit would also change his eating behaviour, the scientists performed a dinner-time experiment. After Molaison had eaten a meal, the staff at his care home cleared the table and, within one minute, gave him a second meal. Amazingly, he ate almost all of it, leaving only the salad. Even then, he showed only a moderate increase in satiety, whereas most people would experience a complete loss of appetite after two substantial meals.5 Without a memory of what he had eaten, he seemed to have no way of regulating his food consumption.

How could this be? There is no doubt that appetite comes partly from the activity in the digestive system, the so-called ‘bottom-up’ sources of information. When we eat, the gut starts to stretch to make room for the food. We have sensors in the muscles surrounding the oesophagus and gastrointestinal tract that can detect this movement. They pass their signals through the vagal nerve into the brain, and help to create a feeling of reward and satisfaction when we are full (or a bloated feeling when we have eaten too much).6 The gut also has its own chemical receptors that can detect the presence of nutrients, such as fat or protein, and when they are stimulated they release hormones that curb our hunger.7

It seems that the prediction machine has to draw on other top-down sources of information – such as memory and expectation – to make sense of information coming in from the gut and to create the sense of hunger or satiation. Without the capacity to form a memory of the day’s meals, Molaison’s brain wasn’t able to contextualise bodily signals in this way, meaning that he would never feel fully sated after a meal.

In one notable experiment, Higgs invited a group of students into her lab after lunch to perform a taste test on some cookies – which, after completing a couple of questionnaires, they were free to consume. Higgs found that simply prompting the subjects to remember their lunch – by spending a few minutes noting down their recollection of what they had eaten – reduced their total consumption by about 45 per cent, compared to participants who wrote about their general thoughts and feelings rather than their food memories. It was a difference of around four cookies per person. This was not the case for students who wrote about a meal from the day before – a more distant event that would have had little effect on their feelings of satiety at that moment. Instead, it was expectations of current satiety, based on recent memory, that seemed to matter.9

The role of memory and expectation in creating a sense of satiety also explains why the appearance of food can inordinately influence how much we eat. In 2012, a team at the University of Bristol first showed their participants a bowl of either 300ml or 500ml of cream of tomato soup, which they were asked to eat. Unbeknown to the participants, however, the bowl was rigged with a small pump that could either increase or reduce the amount of soup that they actually consumed. As a result, some participants believed they were eating 500ml of soup – a relatively large portion – when they were actually eating a more standard 300ml, and vice versa. Sure enough, the participants’ hunger, over the next 3 hours, was largely determined by what they had remembered seeing rather than the amount they had actually consumed. If they had eaten 300ml, but seen 500ml in the bowl, they felt much less hungry than participants who had eaten more but seen less. Their sense of fullness and satisfaction was almost completely the result of their ‘expected satiety’: that is, it was based on their visual memory of what they believed they had eaten rather than the food they actually consumed.

With a simple change of mindset and no actual alteration of the shake’s nutritional content, Crum’s team appeared to have shifted the hormonal profiles of the participants: in one instance, it set them up for greater satiation and an increased metabolism; on the other, it primed them for greater hunger and reduced metabolism.17 ‘When people think they are eating healthily, that’s associated with the sense of deprivation,’ Crum concludes.18 ‘And that mindset matters in shaping our physiological response.’

People taking a low-calorie drink labelled as a ‘treat’ show a more pronounced response in the hypothalamus, for instance, compared with those who had been given a ‘healthy’ drink. Indeed, the response to the ‘treat’ label looked very similar to the activity observed when participants actually drank a high-calorie Ben & Jerry’s shake.19 Based solely on verbal information, the brain was apparently adjusting its predicted energy intake and expenditure – irrespective of the actual content of the glass.

Pleasure and Pain Are Co-Located In addition to the discovery of dopamine, neuroscientists have determined that pleasure and pain are processed in overlapping brain regions and work via an opponent-process mechanism. Another way to say this is that pleasure and pain work like a balance. Imagine our brains contain a balance—a scale with a fulcrum in the center. When nothing is on the balance, it’s level with the ground. When we experience pleasure, dopamine is released in our reward pathway and the balance tips to the side of pleasure. The more our balance tips, and the faster it tips, the more pleasure we feel.

When nothing is on the balance, it’s level with the ground. When we experience pleasure, dopamine is released in our reward pathway and the balance tips to the side of pleasure. The more our balance tips, and the faster it tips, the more pleasure we feel. But here’s the important thing about the balance: It wants to remain level, that is, in equilibrium. It does not want to be tipped for very long to one side or another. Hence, every time the balance tips toward pleasure, powerful self-regulating mechanisms kick into action to bring it level again. These self-regulating mechanisms do not require conscious thought or an act of will. They just happen, like a reflex.

The gremlins represent the work of homeostasis: the tendency of any living system to maintain physiologic equilibrium. Once the balance is level, it keeps going, tipping an equal and opposite amount to the side of pain. In the 1970s, social scientists Richard Solomon and John Corbit called this reciprocal relationship between pleasure and pain the opponent-process theory: “Any prolonged or repeated departures from hedonic or affective neutrality . . . have a cost.”

With repeated exposure to the same or similar pleasure stimulus, the initial deviation to the side of pleasure gets weaker and shorter and the after-response to the side of pain gets stronger and longer, a process scientists call neuroadaptation.

Tolerance (Neuroadaptation) We’ve all experienced craving in the aftermath of pleasure. Whether it’s reaching for a second potato chip or clicking the link for another round of video games, it’s natural to want to re-create those good feelings or try not to let them fade away. The simple solution is to keep eating, or playing, or watching, or reading. But there’s a problem with that. With repeated exposure to the same or similar pleasure stimulus, the initial deviation to the side of pleasure gets weaker and shorter and the after-response to the side of pain gets stronger and longer, a process scientists call neuroadaptation. That is, with repetition, our gremlins get bigger, faster, and more numerous, and we need more of our drug of choice to get the same effect. Needing more of a substance to feel pleasure, or experiencing less pleasure at a given dose, is called tolerance. Tolerance is an important factor in the development of addiction.

With prolonged, heavy drug use, the pleasure-pain balance eventually gets weighted to the side of pain. Our hedonic (pleasure) set point changes as our capacity to experience pleasure goes down and our vulnerability to pain goes up. You might think of this as the gremlins camped out on the pain side of the balance, inflatable mattresses and portable barbecues in tow.

Volkow examined dopamine transmission in the brains of healthy controls compared to people addicted to a variety of drugs two weeks after they stopped using. The brain images are striking. In the brain pictures of healthy controls, a kidney-bean-shaped area of the brain associated with reward and motivation lights up bright red, indicating high levels of dopamine neurotransmitter activity. In the pictures of people with addiction who stopped using two weeks prior, the same kidney-bean-shaped region of the brain contains little or no red, indicating little or no dopamine transmission. As Dr. Volkow and her colleagues wrote, “The decreases in DA D2 receptors in the drug abusers, coupled to the decreases in DA release, would result in a decreased sensitivity of reward circuits to stimulation by natural rewards.” Once this happens, nothing feels good anymore. To put it another way, the players on Team Dopamine take their balls and their mitts and go home.

The paradox is that hedonism, the pursuit of pleasure for its own sake, leads to anhedonia, which is the inability to enjoy pleasure of any kind. Reading had always been my primary source of pleasure and escape, so it was a shock and a grief when it stopped working. Even then it was hard to abandon. My patients with addiction describe how they get to a point where their drug stops working for them. They get no high at all anymore. Yet if they don’t take their drug, they feel miserable. The universal symptoms of withdrawal from any addictive substance are anxiety, irritability, insomnia, and dysphoria.

Here’s the good news. If we wait long enough, our brains (usually) readapt to the absence of the drug and we reestablish our baseline homeostasis: a level balance. Once our balance is level, we are again able to take pleasure in everyday, simple rewards. Going for a walk. Watching the sun rise. Enjoying a meal with friends.

People, Places, and Things The pleasure-pain balance is triggered not only by reexpo-sure to the drug itself but also by exposure to cues associated with drug use. In Alcoholics Anonymous, the catchphrase to describe this phenomenon is people, places, and things. In the world of neuroscience, this is called cue-dependent learning, also known as classical (Pavlovian) conditioning.

Right after the conditioned cue, brain dopamine firing decreases not just to baseline levels (the brain has a tonic level of dopamine firing even in the absence of rewards), but below baseline levels. This transient dopamine mini-deficit state is what motivates us to seek out our reward. Dopamine levels below baseline drive craving. Craving translates into purposeful activity to obtain the drug.

How does cue-induced craving translate to our pleasure-pain balance? The balance tips to the side of pleasure (a dopamine mini spike) in anticipation of future reward, immediately followed by a tip to the side of pain (a dopamine mini deficit) in the aftermath of the cue. The dopamine deficit is craving and drives drug-seeking behavior.

Studies indicate that dopamine release as a result of gambling links to the unpredictability of the reward delivery, as much as to the final (often monetary) reward itself. The motivation to gamble is based largely on the inability to predict the reward occurrence, rather than on financial gain.

This means that although the brain changes are permanent, we can find new synaptic pathways to create healthy behaviors.

The net effect is that we now need more reward to feel pleasure, and less injury to feel pain. This recalibration is occurring not just at the level of the individual but also at the level of nations. Which invites the question: How do we survive and thrive in this new ecosystem? How do we raise our children? What new ways of thinking and acting will be required of us as denizens of the twenty-first century? Who better to teach us how to avoid compulsive over-consumption than those most vulnerable to it: those struggling with addiction.

The a in DOPAMINE stands for abstinence. Abstinence is necessary to restore homeostasis, and with it our ability to get pleasure from less potent rewards, as well as see the true cause and effect between our substance use and the way we’re feeling. To put it in terms of the pleasure-pain balance, fasting from dopamine allows sufficient time for the gremlins to hop off the balance and for the balance to go back to the level position.

Naturally I’ve seen patients who need less than four weeks to reset their reward pathway, and others who need far longer. Those who have been using more potent drugs in larger quantities for longer duration will typically need more time. Younger people recalibrate faster than older people, their brains being more plastic. Furthermore, physical withdrawal varies drug to drug. It can be minor for some drugs like video games but potentially life-threatening for others, like alcohol and benzodiazepines.

Also, the brain can do some pretty weird things, some of which are embarrassing, hence the need for being without judgment. Reserving judgment is important to the practice of mindfulness because as soon as we start condemning what our brain is doing—Ewww! Why would I be thinking about that? I’m a loser. I’m a freak—we stop being able to observe. Staying in the observer position is essential to getting to know our brains and ourselves in a new way.

Mindfulness practices are especially important in the early days of abstinence. Many of us use high-dopamine substances and behaviors to distract ourselves from our own thoughts. When we first stop using dopamine to escape, those painful thoughts, emotions, and sensations come crashing down on us. The trick is to stop running away from painful emotions, and instead allow ourselves to tolerate them. When we’re able to do this, our experience takes on a new and unexpectedly rich texture. The pain is still there, but somehow transformed, seeming to encompass a vast landscape of communal suffering, rather than being wholly our own.

Self-binding is the term to describe Jacob’s act of throwing out his machine. It is the way we intentionally and willingly create barriers between ourselves and our drug of choice in order to mitigate compulsive overconsumption. Self-binding is not primarily a matter of will, although personal agency plays some part. Rather, self-binding openly recognizes the limitations of will. The key to creating effective self-binding is first to acknowledge the loss of voluntariness we experience when under the spell of a powerful compulsion, and to bind ourselves while we still possess the capacity for voluntary choice.

High-dopamine goods mess with our ability to delay gratification, a phenomenon called delay discounting. Delay discounting refers to the fact that the value of a reward goes down the longer we have to wait for it. Most of us would rather get twenty dollars today than a year from now. Our tendency to overvalue short-term rewards over longer-term ones can be influenced by many factors. One of those factors is consumption of addictive drugs and behaviors.

When participants delayed their reward, the prefrontal cortex— the part of the brain involved in planning and abstract thinking—became active. The implication here is that we are all now vulnerable to prefrontal cortical atrophy as our reward pathway has become the dominant driver of our lives.

Exercise increases many of the neurotransmitters involved in positive mood regulation: dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, epinephrine, endocannabinoids, and endogenous opioid peptides (endorphins). Exercise contributes to the birth of new neurons and supporting glial cells. Exercise even reduces the likelihood of using and getting addicted to drugs.

The most likely explanation for Honnold’s brain differences is the development of tolerance to fear through neuroadaptation. My guess is that Honnold’s brain started out no different from the average brain in terms of fear sensitivity. What’s different now is that he has trained his brain through years of climbing not to react to fearful stimuli. It takes a lot more to scare Honnold’s brain than the average person’s because he has incrementally exposed himself to death-defying feats.

Scientists have shown that stress alone can increase the release of dopamine in the brain’s reward pathway, leading to the same brain changes seen with addictive drugs like cocaine and methamphetamine. Just as we become tolerant to pleasure stimuli with repeated exposure, so too can we become tolerant to painful stimuli, resetting our brains to the side of pain.

Third, it leads to a truthful autobiography, which holds us accountable not just to our present but also to our future selves.

When the people around us are reliable and tell us the truth, including keeping promises they’ve made to us, we feel more confident about the world and our own future in it. We feel we can rely not just on them but also on the world to be an orderly, predictable, safe kind of a place. Even in the midst of scarcity, we feel confident that things will turn out okay. This is a plenty mindset. When the people around us lie and don’t keep their promises, we feel less confident about the future. The world becomes a dangerous place that can’t be relied upon to be orderly, predictable, or safe. We go into competitive survival mode and favor short-term gains over long-term ones, independent of actual material wealth. This is a scarcity mindset.

So the last thing we'd want to do with Chris and Gina is spend the majority of our time talking about what has been going wrong. But we don't have peak experiences on the sine-wave chart to serve as exceptions to their problem patterns. Indeed, their very problem—their deadly immersion in routine—is the absence of peak experience. How to proceed? The answer, as I alluded earlier, is to create a bridge between present and future. What's the one thing holding the couple together? Their love for and commitment to their children. Will they work on their marriage if that would feel like taking time away from the kids? Of course not. Without a bridge, they remain stuck in the present: They won't trade a known priority for an uncertain one. So we need a way to pursue the future while holding onto present commitments. We are most likely to change if our efforts feel evolutionary, not revolutionary.

Traders very often overinterpret these random ups and downs in the P/L curve. When they have strings of winning trades, they convince themselves that they are seeing markets well and increase their risk taking. When they encounter a series of losing trades, they become concerned about slumps and reduce their risk taking. Those adjustments ultimately cost the trader money. Imagine a baseball player who gauged his performance every 20 or so at-bats. When he gets a large number of hits, he considers himself to have a hot hand and swings even harder at pitches. When he strikes out a number of times, he talks himself into changing his swing to get out of his slump. Both adjustments take the batter out of his game. Ignoring short-term outcomes and focusing on the consistency of the swing is a far more promising approach to batting performance.

In part, our focus on conviction as a success driver may simply reflect the cognitive consequences of survivorship bias. In any group of traders, the ones who lead the pack in absolute returns will almost certainly be high risk-takers. Now, of course, the cohort of worst-performing traders will also include the high risk-takers. After all, few market participants blow up their books on small bets and low conviction trades. But if we're looking for the successful market wizards, we'll usually identify those who have made the most money and, if we talk to them, we'll generally discover that they went all-in on at least some of their trades. That hindsight perspective easily leads to the assumption that a defining element of trading success is supreme confidence and risk taking.

Most traders rate themselves as above average in ability, despite results that generally don't support such a view. When asked about the discrepancy between their self-perception and their actual trading performance, they cite their potential, their recent improvement, situational influences hampering performance, and the like. The problem is that traders who overrate their abilities are not likely to be proactive in recognizing the need to adapt to shifting market conditions. Joe viewed himself to be a very successful trader and attributed his recent poor performance to a “slump.” That led him to seek help with his psyche, though what he needed was a way of adapting to an altered market-making environment.

Such situations starkly illustrate that it's not a lack of knowledge or information that keeps us from making changes. All too often, we know precisely what we need to do—and we don't do it! We know we're supposed to hold the trade to our target level, but at the first wiggle against us, we're bailing out. We know we're supposed to exercise, but we stay sedentary behind our screens, drawing on ever-dwindling energy reserves.

sense of caring and connectedness. Every morning I wake up early and, before diving into my work, greet our four cats, pet them, and feed them breakfast. Each cat has her likes and dislikes, and each cat has her particular feeding bowl. I prepare four breakfasts and serve them one at a time to Naomi, Ginger, Mia, and Mali. That's a routine I love. The closeness I feel with those purring friends is the best way I can think of to start my day. Similarly, I will spend hours searching through employment ads and reworking resumes if it will aid the job search for one of my children. When we go over resumes or practice interviews, it's not just helping them, which is important; it's also doing something important together. Routine doesn't feel like routine when I feel a connection, when I'm making a contribution, or when I perceive a deep purpose to the activity. Suppose one of my children needed to perform difficult physical therapy as part of their rehabilitation from an injury. I would gladly join in the exercises and make the challenging therapy a shared effort. In such a situation, I would never avoid workouts, because of my deep commitment to my child. It's not that I would have to overcome procrastination. By tapping into a core motivation, I would encounter no emotional resistance whatsoever. That's

That's it: core motivation. It was Maxwell's core motivation to prove himself that led him to put prediction aside and maximize his scalping. It was Gina and Chris's core motivation to provide a great home for their children that sparked them to develop their marriage. In an important sense, people never change: Instead, they find fresh ways to express the core motivations that define their life themes. Solution-focused coaching works to the degree that it catalyzes those fresh expressions of who we already are.

One of the most common questions I hear from traders is how to not become overemotional during trading, especially when losing money. Not infrequently, traders will lose money and become frustrated or anxious. Frustration leads to impulsive decision making; anxiety leads to paralysis. Both nudge the trader away from best trading practices. The underlying problem is that losses are viewed as threats. If risk management is poor, losses can be financial threats. If self-management is poor, losses can be threats to confidence and self-esteem.

The losses can correct our views of markets or prod us to examine how we are trading those markets. Losses have a purpose; they can make us better, if only we can learn their lessons.

Note, however, an additional benefit to the embracing of loss: It turns trade review into a habit, and that in turn makes adaptation a continuous routine.

Try the flowchart exercise: Start with the ways in which you generate trade ideas and then capture the decisions you make regarding how and when you turn those ideas into trades and how you manage their risk/reward. The flowchart should capture how you prepare for the trading day and how you review your trading. Try to make the chart so detailed that a reader would be able to replicate much of how you trade. How detailed is your flowchart? How many alternatives for making money does it capture? How well does it structure the times when you shouldn't be trading? How well would the process captured in the chart adapt to changes in market conditions? If your process isn't flexible and adaptive on paper, can we really expect it to provide you with viable alternatives in the heat of battle? A good football team prepares a number of running and passing plays and flexibly draws on those to exploit the defense on the field. Our playbooks need a similar level of flexibility.

Traders who approach markets in a rigid way are not so different from the self-absorbed person who corners you at the office party. They impose their views on markets, not infrequently pontificating on politics, economics, chart patterns, or esoteric market theories. When markets offer their own communications—breaking out of ranges on increased institutional participation with an expansion of volatility, for example—those fixed traders are so focused on their own views that they fail to listen to the market's message.

Analyze-think is critical to knowing what to incorporate and what to filter out, but before you analyze-think, it's necessary to see-feel.

One of the habit patterns most important to cultivate as a trader is the ability to lose in a way that gives you energy, rather than robs you of initiative. Of course, losses will be frustrating to a competitive trader, but frustration need not be paralyzing. If you have built a process whereby you routinely look for mistakes and turn them into fuel for self-improvement, you have turned the transition from contemplation into action into a habit. Every mistake is an opportunity—and an obligation—to do something different, something better. Less-than-ideal trading becomes a trigger to work on your ideal self.

Worry is a form of negative thinking different from depression. Depression tends to be backward looking, blaming the self and casting doubt on the future. Worry is forward looking, anticipating that bad things will happen. The depressed person says, “I can't.” The worried person says, “I'm afraid to try.” A common observation among traders is that worry can lead to problems with “pulling the trigger” on sound trade ideas. More psychologically attuned to potential loss than reward, the worried trader takes the “safe” route and fails to act.

The breakthrough occurred when Naomi was on the bed, enticed by food. I put my hand under the cover and moved it around and—just as with the fly—Naomi's eyes got large. She arched her body and went after my hand. She was so intent on hunting the moving thing under the bedcovers that she forgot to be fearful! That's when I realized that our newest household member had taught me a valuable lesson about change. When we are in our normal state of mind and body, acting on our normal motivations, nothing changes. When everything is normal, our behavior gravitates to our norm. If, however, we can substitute a stronger motivation for the one that leaves us passive, procrastinating, or troubled, the fresh energy sparks behavior that previously had been elusive.

Relapses tend to occur during periods in which we lose mindfulness. Mindfulness is a state in which we are self-aware, as emotionally neutral observers to ourselves. When we are in a mindful state, we don't react to situations; we observe ourselves responding to situations.

McGonigal's (2012) distinction between reward and happiness lies at the heart of many relapsed efforts at change. What would make us happy is losing the weight. What feels rewarding is eating from the dessert tray at the party. The problem is that what is rewarding ultimately does not bring us happiness and, indeed, can sabotage our longer-term satisfaction.

What feels rewarding is eating from the dessert tray at the party. The problem is that what is rewarding ultimately does not bring us happiness and, indeed, can sabotage our longer-term satisfaction. Most traders know what happens when they get caught up in short-term market action and enter a position they would never contemplate had they engaged in mindful planning. The promise of quick reward from a short-term trade temporarily overwhelms the longer-term happiness of following a sound business plan for one's trading.

One of the psychological factors that depletes our willpower is negativity. When we make ourselves miserable with self-blame and worry, it is much easier to seek solace in immediate reward. Such negative thinking robs us of energy, and that robs us of willpower. Conversely, it is much easier to stick to a diet or a trading plan when we concretely see the benefits coming to us. And, of course, once a new behavior pattern becomes a habit, it no longer takes willpower to sustain it.

By quieting the mind and body, perhaps by focusing on deep, regular breathing, meditation places people in a state that is incompatible with emotional arousal. When a stressful event occurs, we respond with fear or frustration and our bodies go into overdrive, preparing us for fight or flight. Part of that overdrive involves the blood flow shifting to the motor centers of the brain and away from the executive centers that facilitate our planning and reasoning. This is why I mentioned in my earlier books that worked-up traders are literally out of their minds. They analyze and plan their trades with the frontal cortex activated and then, in the heat of market action, act out of the fight-or-flight responses of their motor centers.

Years of working in proprietary trading firms, banks, and hedge funds have taught me that there are two types of trader: one who is drawn to trading for negative reasons; the other who is drawn for positive ones. The person who is drawn to trading for negative reasons is looking for an escape. Perhaps it's an escape from working an 8-to-5 routine; perhaps it's an escape from working for someone else; perhaps it's an escape from past failures and shortcomings; perhaps it's an escape from hard work. In all those cases, trading is the playing out of a fantasy—the hope that it will be possible to be maximally successful with minimal effort. Those drawn to trading for positive reasons find in trading an ideal fit of values, skills, and interests. Trading becomes an expression of their identity—an exercise of their strengths, not an avoidance of their vulnerabilities.

In the case of my trading adaptation, the inventory of profitable and unprofitable trading revealed that time was a crucial element. The likelihood of losing money was directly proportional to the frequency of my trading. When I took the time to synthesize my market research and formulate overarching scenarios, I was much more likely to participate in meaningful market moves. When I traded patterns setting up in markets, heedless of a larger context, I inevitably lost money. What seemed like random performance was actually quite meaningful once I pulled out successful and unsuccessful trades.

Many journals maintained by traders are filled with descriptions of problems and frustrations. Few track strengths and their application to trading. Much of the time, if trading goes well, we don't feel a tremendous need to analyze our performance. It is only when we begin to go off the rails that we reflect on what has gone wrong.

When you lament that this work is very tiring, despite not working hard, you will feel exhausted, in other words there is a huge difference. This is how things are. John, if you view work as a pleasure, life is heaven; if you view work as a duty, life is hell. Reflect on your work attitude, it will make everyone happy.

Yes, everyone will be worried and scared when deciding on a huge event and will be faced with a dilemma. But the “action group” will use the determination to ignite the sparks in their soul, come up with various ways to fulfil their wishes, and gain the courage to overcome all kinds of difficulties.

But the “action group” will use the determination to ignite the sparks in their soul, come up with various ways to fulfil their wishes, and gain the courage to overcome all kinds of difficulties. Many people who lack action are naive and like to sit and wait for things to happen naturally. They naively think that others will care about their affairs.

Many people make themselves into a passive person. They want to wait until all conditions are perfect, that is, when the time is right, before taking action. Life is an opportunity at any time, but there is almost nothing perfect. Those passive people have a mediocre life, precisely because they must wait for everything to be 100% profitable and perfectly safe before doing something. This is a fool’s approach. We must compromise in life and believe that what is in hand is the opportunity we need now, so that we can keep ourselves out of the quagmire of waiting forever before falling into action.

To become the kind of person who “will do it now”, you must stop daydreaming, and to always think of the present and start doing it now. Sentences such as “tomorrow”, “next week”, and “future” have the same meaning as “can never be done”.

Of course, to win the competition, courage is only one aspect of winning, and you also need to have strength. Crutches cannot replace strong and powerful feet. We must stand on our own feet and rely on ourselves. If your feet are not strong enough to support you, you should not give up and admit defeat, but should work hard to hone, strengthen and develop your feet and let them exert their power.

More people make money by borrowing money. The reason is not esoteric. Buying and selling a dollar profit each is far less profitable than buying and selling a hundred dollars.

Look at those poor people and you will know that they are not incompetent or stupid neither are they not hard-working. They are deprived from opportunities. You need to know that we live in a jungle where the weak are prey to the strong, where you either eat people or risk being eaten by someone else.

However, these pigs were very cunning and could never be fooled. John, when the pigs start to become independent, they will become tough and smart. One day, an old man was chasing a donkey that was dragging a two-wheeled cart with a lot of wood and grain when he walked into a village where the “wild boars” roamed. The locals were very curious, so they walked forward and asked the old man: “Where are you from, what are you going to do?” The old man told them, “I’ll help you catch the wild boars!” The villagers laughed at him as soon as they heard it: “Don't be funny now, how can you do something that even a good hunter could not do.” However, two months later, the old man came back and told the villagers in that village that the wild boars had been locked in a fence on the top of the mountain. The villagers were surprised again, and asked the old man: “Really? Unbelievable, how did you catch them?" The old man explained, "First of all, go to a place where wild boars often come out to eat. Then, I put some food in the middle of the open space as a bait for the trap. The pigs were startled at first, but eventually ran over curiously to smell the food. Soon an old wild boar ate the first bite, and other wild boars followed. I knew then, I must be able to catch them. “The next day, I added a little more food and planted a plank a few feet away. The board temporarily frightened them off like a ghost, but the free lunch was tempting, so they soon ran back to continue eating. At the time, the wild boar did not know that they were going to be mine. After that, all I have to do is to plant a few more boards around the grain every day until my trap is complete.” “Then I dug a hole and erected the first corner pile. Every time I add something, they will stay away for some time, but in the end, they will come again for free lunch. The fence is built, and the trap door is ready. Well, the habit of getting something for nothing made them walk into the fence without any hesitation. At this time, I unexpectedly put away the trap, and the pigs that ate free lunch were easily caught by me.” The moral of this story is simple, when an animal depends on humans for food, its wit will be taken away, and then it will be in trouble. The same situation applies to human beings. If you want to make a person disabled, just give him a pair of crutches, and wait for a few months to achieve your goal. In other words, if you give someone a free lunch for a certain period, he/she will develop the habit of getting something for nothing. Do not forget, everyone has a need to be “taken care of” in the womb.

Once any person develops a habit, whether it is good or bad, the habit will always possess him. The habit of eating lunch for nothing will not help a person progress, but only make him lose the chance to win. But hard work is the only reliable way out. Work is the price we pay for enjoying success. Wealth and happiness can only be obtained by hard work.

Be the foolish smart person People who have not experienced misfortune are unfortunate. Give a pig a good compliment, and it can climb up the tree. A person who is smart is a fool, and a person who knows how to play a fool is smart. (The leaders who offer high sentiments always win in the end, and get more out of their followers)

Interest and enthusiasm are important factors that determine success or failure. The outcome of things is often proportional to our enthusiasm. Enthusiasm can make things a hundred times or a thousand times better. Many people do not know what enthusiasm is. The so-called enthusiasm refers to “this is amazing!” – this level of enthusiasm and drive. I believe that an average-talented person who has an optimistic, positive and cooperative attitude towards the world will earn more money and win more respect as compared to a talented but pessimistic, passive and uncooperative person.

It is almost certain that safety first cannot make us rich. If we want to get paid, we must always accept the necessary risks that follow. Isn’t life like this? There is no such thing as maintaining the status quo. If you do not advance, you will retreat. It is that simple. In my aspect, being cautious is not the perfect way to succeed. No matter what we do, or even our lives, we must choose between taking risks and being cautious. And sometimes, the chance of winning by taking risks is much greater than by being cautious.

What is the point of having a photographer take a picture of you! Having the world’s most famous painter paint you a portrait would then be considered a pride of its own!

Using your strength to scare your opponents The more you think you can do it, the smarter you will get. When it comes to money, never mention the amount first. When you are in business, you must not want all the money for yourself, but keep a little money for others to earn. (I believe that the world can be changed by man's endeavour, and that this endeavour can lead to something new and better.)

There must be a spirit of cooperation Treat others the way you wish to be treated. A friendship built on business is far better than a business built on friendship. Be nice to others when you climb up, because you will run into them when you go downhill. (The essence of life is struggle and competition. Struggle and competition are stimulating.)

For thousands of years, many philosophers have advised us: Know yourself. However, most people interpret it as just knowing the negative side of themselves. Most self-assessments include too many shortcomings, mistakes, and incompetence. It is good to recognize your own shortcomings and you can use this to seek improvement. However, if we only recognize the negative side of ourselves, we will fall into chaos and make ourselves worthless.

However, if we only recognize the negative side of ourselves, we will fall into chaos and make ourselves worthless. For those who long for others to respect them, the reality is cruel, because others will think of him the same way he thinks of himself. We will all be treated like “what we think we are”. Those who think that they are a bit worse than others, no matter what their actual ability is, will definitely be a bit worse than others, because the mind itself can regulate and control various actions. If a person feels that he is inferior to others, he will show “true” actions that are inferior to others; and this feeling cannot be hidden or concealed. Those who think they are “not very important” will eventually become “not very important” people.

Almost everyone knows that whether you can build a happy life and achieve success is related to how you use your time. However, for many people, time is their enemy. They kill it and obliterate it; but if anyone steals their time, they will be furious, because time is money after all, and the most important time is life. Unfortunately, they just do not know how to use their time.

First, people who like to live a glamorous life, like flies staring at a stinky meat. They are very interested in luxury goods. They spend so much that they do their best to have exquisite costumes, expensive cars, luxurious houses, and highly sought-after art. This kind of life is indeed fascinating, but it lacks rationality, and they lack such vigilance: They are looking for ways to increase debt, and they will become poor slaves to cars and houses, and once they go bankrupt, they are finished! The second type of people, are those who like to save money, and store it in the bank, but it is no different from freezing money.  <You have reached the clipping limit for this item>

Dopamine and constant stimulation can impair your ability to think long term Studies have shown that one of the best predictors of success is the ability to think long term. People who repeatedly focus on where they want to be in the future, make better decisions in the present. They tend to eat healthier food, be more productive at work and save and invest more money than others.

By receiving constant feedback, whether through likes, comments, or immediate replies to our messages, we condition ourselves to expect fast results with everything we do. And this feeling is certainly reinforced through ads for schemes to help us “get rich quick”, and through cognitive biases (i.e., we only hear about the richest and most successful YouTubers, not about the ones who fail).

Staying calm and focusing on the one task in front of you every day will. The point is, to achieve long-term goals in your personal or professional life, you must regain control of your attention and rewire your brain to focus on the long term. To do so, you should start by staying away from highly stimulating activities.

The problem with overstimulation When you’re engaging in highly stimulating activities, your brain will keep demanding more and more stimulation. As your level of stimulation rises, regular tasks will appear increasingly dull and unappealing. You’ll ask yourself, why work on my book, write a report or create a marketing plan when I could be doing something far more exciting?

It will try to convince you that you can start work whenever you choose, that you’re in control of your actions. But this couldn’t be further from the truth. In most cases, you won’t be able to get back to work for hours. You might even find yourself postponing your key tasks until the next day.

Whenever you enter an open system, you risk becoming overstimulated. For instance, if the first thing you do in the morning is to check Facebook, you might find yourself: Scrolling down your newsfeed for no reason, Watching one video after the next, or Messaging a friend and entering a long conversation. Once you finally close Facebook, you might find yourself so stimulated, you’ll struggle to begin work.

3. Understand that the world is against you In today’s world, maintaining focus has become incredibly difficult. That’s because everybody is vying for our attention. And I’m not just talking about our family members, friends, or colleagues. I’m also talking about marketers, YouTubers, or bloggers. Nowadays more than ever, the ability to attract people’s attention is one of the biggest sources of income for many companies. In short, your focus is worth a lot of money, which is why YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram do everything they can to keep you glued to your screen. However, your focus is also worth a lot of money to you. When you reclaim your focus and use it to achieve your biggest goals, you can transform your life radically.

Boredom. Practicing doing nothing is a good way to lower your level of stimulation. Our mind constantly wants to do things. For a moment, be okay with doing nothing. Sit down and observe things, eat in silence or walk with no specific intent or destination in mind. By incorporating some of the above activities, you’ll be calmer and more present during your day. As a result, you will reduce the risk of becoming overstimulated.

What our mind hates above all are open loops. Open loops consist of all the unfinished tasks it must think about in the background, such as: Unanswered emails, Unpaid taxes, Incomplete projects, Unfinished conversations, Chores, Unresolved issues, and so on. When you keep accumulating unfinished business, you create multiple open loops that take up mental space. Feeling overwhelmed, your mind’s natural reaction is to shut down. As a result, you find yourself stuck.

Because we lie to ourselves, pretending that our future self will do the work for us tomorrow, next week, or next year. It gets even worse when we perceive our future self in a completely unrealistic way. We see our future selves as better, stronger, and wiser than we currently are.

2. Surviving vs. thriving As we’ve seen before, your mind is designed to ensure your survival. But it isn’t designed to help you thrive. Many people allow their old brain to dictate their actions (or lack thereof). They accept that if they don’t feel like doing something, they shouldn’t do it. These people merely survive. They avoid facing their fears and fail to make extra effort to achieve their goals. If you want to thrive, you must understand that your brain is, in many respects, obsolete. You must overcome your fear of rejection, lack of motivation, and the other issues that stem from the way your old brain operates. The business philosopher, Jim Rohn, said, “As a human being, you’ve been given the dignity of choice. While other living beings rely on their instincts, you have the power to overrule your basic instincts and negative feelings so as to grow and become more. In a way, procrastination is the ever-present tension we experience between our animal instincts and our higher purpose. It is the cost of being human.” At any time, you can decide whether you want to survive or thrive. The choice is yours. Action step 1. Using your action guide, rate yourself from 1 to 10 (where 1 is low and 10 is high) on the following elements: I know exactly why I procrastinate. I understand exactly how motivation works. I understand that procrastination comes from flawed thinking. 2. Based on what you learned today, write down two specific things you will implement today to avoid procrastinating on your most important tasks or things you know you should be doing. 3. Write down what the long-term consequences will be if you keep procrastinating. Think of the worst-case scenarios. What dreams will remain unfulfilled? What goals will you fail to achieve? What will happen to your health? Visualize in detail the real cost of procrastination in your life. Make it painful

1. I need to beat myself up to get things done. Many people fear that if they aren’t harsh with themselves, they will become complacent, but this couldn’t be further from the truth. Such belief comes from a lack of faith and trust in oneself. As you practice self-compassion and learn to trust yourself, you’ll discover that your motivation will increase, leading you to accomplish more. Try it for yourself. 2. Self-compassion is selfish. For some people, self-compassion may appear selfish, but it isn’t the case. In truth, if you cannot take care of yourself, you’ll have little mental energy left to take care of the people around you. The more self-compassionate you become, the better you’ll feel and the better you’ll treat people.

In a sense, we can say that procrastination is mostly a habit—and a bad one. Since our mind tends to shy away from challenging tasks, we need to retrain it to make it work for us, not against us. One of the most effective ways to do so is by implementing a daily routine. Once you do something consistently every day for a long enough period of time, it becomes a rock-solid habit. And just one or two rock-solid habits sustained over the long term can have a massive, positive impact on your life.

1. Decide when and where you’ll do your daily routine To help prime your mind, start your daily routine at the same time and in the same place each day. As you immerse yourself in your task, the inspiration and motivation will arrive, and you’ll realize it wasn’t that hard after all. 2. Decide exactly what you’ll be doing The next step is to determine what to include in your morning routine. Choose simple activities that help you enter a focused state. For instance, you could meditate for a few minutes, make yourself a cup of tea or carry out breathing exercises. Make sure you avoid checking your phone, watching YouTube videos, or any other distractions. You need to avoid such stimulation as much as possible to help you stay focused. 3. Get started Once you’ve completed your routine, begin work immediately. If possible, tackle your most important task first. When you complete your main task, you will experience a pleasant sense of accomplishment that will help you accomplish more tasks during the day.

4. Work without interruption Finally, make sure that you can work free of distractions. If you can, turn off your phone or the Wi-Fi. Remove any friction to facilitate the completion of your task. Your important tasks should be as easy as possible to start while distractions should be as difficult as possible to engage in. For instance, you could limit the risk of becoming distracted by: Turning off your phone, Turning off the Wi-Fi, and by Using software to block specific websites, like social media.

“Don’t aim at success—the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one’s dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one’s surrender to a person other than oneself.

The salvation of man is through love and in love. I understood how a man who has nothing left in this world still may know bliss, be it only for a brief moment, in the contemplation of his beloved. In a position of utter desolation, when man cannot express himself in positive action, when his only achievement may consist in enduring his sufferings in the right way—an honorable way—in such a position man can, through loving contemplation of the image he carries of his beloved, achieve fulfillment. For the first time in my life I was able to understand the meaning of the words, “The angels are lost in perpetual contemplation of an infinite glory.”

You always think that the worst is still to come, and yet it is over already.” Varying this, we could say that most men in a concentration camp believed that the real opportunities of life had passed. Yet, in reality, there was an opportunity and a challenge. One could make a victory of those experiences, turning life into an inner triumph, or one could ignore the challenge and simply vegetate, as did a majority of the prisoners.

I became disgusted with the state of affairs which compelled me, daily and hourly, to think of only such trivial things. I forced my thoughts to turn to another subject. Suddenly I saw myself standing on the platform of a well-lit, warm and pleasant lecture room. In front of me sat an attentive audience on comfortable upholstered seats. I was giving a lecture on the psychology of the concentration camp! All that oppressed me at that moment became objective, seen and described from the remote viewpoint of science. By this method I succeeded somehow in rising above the situation, above the sufferings of the moment, and I observed them as if they were already of the past. Both I and my troubles became the object of an interesting psychoscientific study undertaken by myself. What does Spinoza say in his Ethics? —“Affectus, qui passio est, desinit esse passio simulatque eius claram et distinctam formamus ideam.” Emotion, which is suffering, ceases to be suffering as soon as we form a clear and precise picture of it.

When a man finds that it is his destiny to suffer, he will have to accept his suffering as his task; his single and unique task.

Thus it can be seen that mental health is based on a certain degree of tension, the tension between what one has already achieved and what one still ought to accomplish, or the gap between what one is and what one should become.

The Meaning of Life I doubt whether a doctor can answer this question in general terms. For the meaning of life differs from man to man, from day to day and from hour to hour.

To put it figuratively, the role played by a logotherapist is that of an eye specialist rather than that of a painter. A painter tries to convey to us a picture of the world as he sees it; an ophthalmologist tries to enable us to see the world as it really is. The logotherapist’s role consists of widening and broadening the visual field of the patient so that the whole spectrum of potential meaning becomes conscious and visible to him.

The more one forgets himself—by giving himself to a cause to serve or another person to love—the more human he is and the more he actualizes himself. What is called self-actualization is not an attainable aim at all, for the simple reason that the more one would strive for it, the more he would miss it. In other words, self-actualization is possible only as a side-effect of self-transcendence.

The Meaning of Love Love is the only way to grasp another human being in the innermost core of his personality. No one can become fully aware of the very essence of another human being unless he loves him. By his love he is enabled to see the essential traits and features in the beloved person; and even more, he sees that which is potential in him, which is not yet actualized but yet ought to be actualized. Furthermore, by his love, the loving person enables the beloved person to actualize these potentialities. By making him aware of what he can be and of what he should become, he makes these potentialities come true.

Let me cite a clear-cut example: Once, an elderly general practitioner consulted me because of his severe depression. He could not overcome the loss of his wife who had died two years before and whom he had loved above all else. Now, how could I help him? What should I tell him? Well, I refrained from telling him anything but instead confronted him with the question, “What would have happened, Doctor, if you had died first, and your wife would have had to survive you?” “Oh,” he said, “for her this would have been terrible; how she would have suffered!” Whereupon I replied, “You see, Doctor, such a suffering has been spared her, and it was you who have spared her this suffering—to be sure, at the price that now you have to survive and mourn her.” He said no word but shook my hand and calmly left my office. In some way, suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning, such as the meaning of a sacrifice.

I then invited the mother of the handicapped son to imagine herself similarly looking back over her life. Let us listen to what she had to say as recorded on the tape: “I wished to have children and this wish has been granted to me; one boy died; the other, however, the crippled one, would have been sent to an institution if I had not taken over his care. Though he is crippled and helpless, he is after all my boy. And so I have made a fuller life possible for him; I have made a better human being out of my son.” At this moment, there was an outburst of tears and, crying, she continued: “As for myself, I can look back peacefully on my life; for I can say my life was full of meaning, and I have tried hard to fulfill it; I have done my best—I have done the best for my son. My life was no failure!” Viewing her life as if from her deathbed, she had suddenly been able to see a meaning in it, a meaning which even included all of her sufferings.

Logotherapy, keeping in mind the essential transitoriness of human existence, is not pessimistic but rather activistic. To express this point figuratively we might say: The pessimist resembles a man who observes with fear and sadness that his wall calendar, from which he daily tears a sheet, grows thinner with each passing day. On the other hand, the person who attacks the problems of life actively is like a man who removes each successive leaf from his calendar and files it neatly and carefully away with its predecessors, after first having jotted down a few diary notes on the back. He can reflect with pride and joy on all the richness set down in these notes, on all the life he has already lived to the fullest. What will it matter to him if he notices that he is growing old? Has he any reason to envy the young people whom he sees, or wax nostalgic over his own lost youth? What reasons has he to envy a young person? For the possibilities that a young person has, the future which is in store for him? “No, thank you,” he will think. “Instead of possibilities, I have realities in my past, not only the reality of work done and of love loved, but of sufferings bravely suffered. These sufferings are even the things of which I am most proud, though these are things which cannot inspire envy.”

This basic capacity to detach one from oneself is actualized whenever the logotherapeutic technique called paradoxical intention is applied. At the same time, the patient is enabled to put himself at a distance from his own neurosis. A statement consistent with this is found in Gordon W. Allport’s book, The Individual and His Religion: “The neurotic who learns to laugh at himself may be on the way to self-management, perhaps to cure.”fn12

A similar case, dealing, however, with speaking rather than writing, was related to me by a colleague in the Laryngological Department of the Vienna Poliklinik Hospital. It was the most severe case of stuttering he had come across in his many years of practice. Never in his life, as far as the stutterer could remember, had he been free from his speech trouble, even for a moment, except once. This happened when he was twelve years old and had hooked a ride on a streetcar. When caught by the conductor, he thought that the only way to escape would be to elicit his sympathy, and so he tried to demonstrate that he was just a poor stuttering boy. At that moment, when he tried to stutter, he was unable to do it. Without meaning to, he had practiced paradoxical intention, though not for therapeutic purposes.

Paradoxical intention can also be applied in cases of sleep disturbance. The fear of sleeplessnessfn13 results in a hyper-intention to fall asleep, which, in turn, incapacitates the patient to do so. To overcome this particular fear, I usually advise the patient not to try to sleep but rather to try to do just the opposite, that is, to stay awake as long as possible. In other words, the hyper-intention to fall asleep, arising from the anticipatory anxiety of not being able to do so, must be replaced by the paradoxical intention not to fall asleep, which soon will be followed by sleep.

Paradoxical intention is no panacea. Yet it lends itself as a useful tool in treating obsessive-compulsive and phobic conditions, especially in cases with underlying anticipatory anxiety. Moreover, it is a short-term therapeutic device. However, one should not conclude that such a short-term therapy necessarily results in only temporary therapeutic effects. One of “the more common illusions of Freudian orthodoxy,” to quote the late Emil A. Gutheil, “is that the durability of results corresponds to the length of therapy.”

A similar chain of events, however, can be observed in obsessive-compulsive cases in which the patient fights the ideas which haunt him.fn16 Thereby, however, he increases their power to disturb him, since pressure precipitates counterpressure. Again the symptom is reinforced! On the other hand, as soon as the patient stops fighting his obsessions and instead tries to ridicule them by dealing with them in an ironical way—by applying paradoxical intention—the vicious circle is cut, the symptom diminishes and finally atrophies.

Man is not fully conditioned and determined but rather determines himself whether he gives in to conditions or stands up to them. In other words, man is ultimately self-determining. Man does not simply exist but always decides what his existence will be, what he will become in the next moment. By the same token, every human being has the freedom to change at any instant. Therefore, we can predict his future only within the large framework of a statistical survey referring to a whole group; the individual personality, however, remains essentially unpredictable

It is obvious to you now that Caruso must have understood the two levels of mind—the conscious or rational, and the subconscious or irrational level. Your subconscious mind is reactive and responds to the nature of your thoughts. When your conscious mind (the Little Me) is full of fear, worry, and anxiety, the negative emotions engendered in your subconscious mind (the Big Me) are released and flood the conscious mind with a sense of panic, foreboding, and despair. When this happens, you can, like Caruso, speak affirmatively and with a deep sense of authority to the irrational emotions generated in your deeper mind as follows: “Be still, be quiet, I am in control, you must obey me, you are subject to my command, you cannot intrude where you do not belong.”

Psychologists and psychiatrists point out that when thoughts are conveyed to your subconscious mind, impressions are made in the brain cells. As soon as your subconscious accepts any idea, it proceeds to put it into effect immediately. It works by association of ideas and uses every bit of knowledge that you have gathered in your lifetime to bring about its purpose. It draws on the infinite power, energy, and wisdom within you. It lines up all the laws of nature to get its way. Sometimes it seems to bring about an immediate solution to your difficulties, but at other times it may take days, weeks, or longer. ...

Different Reactions To The Same Suggestion It is true that different people will react in different ways to the same suggestion because of their subconscious conditioning or belief. For example, if you go to a sailor on the ship and say to him sympathetically, “My dear fellow, you’re looking very ill. Aren’t you feeling sick? You look to me as if you were going to be seasick.” According to his temperament he either laughs at your “joke,” or expresses a mild irritation. Your suggestion fell on deaf ears in this instance because your suggestion of seasickness was associated in his mind with his own immunity from it. Therefore, it called up not fear or worry, but self-confidence.

Therefore, it called up not fear or worry, but self-confidence. The dictionary says that a suggestion is the act or instance of putting something into one’s mind, the mental process by which the thought or idea suggested is entertained, accepted, or put into effect. You must remember that a suggestion cannot impose something on the subconscious mind against the will of the conscious mind. In other words, your conscious mind has the power to reject the suggestion given. In the case of the sailor, he had no fear of seasickness. He had convinced himself of his immunity, and the negative suggestion had absolutely no power to evoke fear.

Three times a day she isolated herself in a room. She sat down comfortably in an armchair, relaxed her body, and closed her eyes. She stilled her mind and body as best she could. Physical inertia favors mental passivity and renders the mind more receptive to suggestion. She counteracted the fear suggestion by saying to herself, “I sing beautifully. I am poised, serene, confident, and calm.” She repeated this statement slowly, quietly, and with feeling from five to ten times at each sitting. She had three such “sittings” every day and one immediately prior to sleep. At the end of a week she was completely poised and confident.

This is the way of seeds, and trusting the laws of growth and agriculture, you know that the seeds will come forth after their kind. Faith as mentioned in the Bible is a way of thinking, an attitude of mind, an inner certitude, knowing that the idea you fully accept in your conscious mind will be embodied in your sub conscious mind and made manifest. Faith is, in a sense, accepting as true what your reason and senses deny, i.e., a shutting out of the little, rational, analytical, conscious mind and embracing an attitude of complete reliance on the inner power of your subconscious mind.

The most wonderful thing to know is this: Imagine the end desired and feel its reality; then the infinite life principle will respond to your conscious choice and your conscious request. This is the meaning of believe you have received, and you shall receive. This is what the modern mental scientist does when he practices prayer therapy.

In prayer therapy you consciously choose a certain idea, mental picture, or plan which you desire to experience. You realize your capacity to convey this idea or mental image to your subconscious by feeling the reality of the state assumed. As you remain faithful in your mental attitude, your prayer will be answered. Prayer therapy is a definite mental action for a definite specific purpose.

Her bodily condition is but a reflection of her thought life like shadows cast on the screen. I know that in order to change the images on the screen I must change the projection reel. My mind is the projection reel, and I now project in my own mind the image of wholeness, harmony, and perfect health for my mother. The infinite healing presence, which created my mother’s body and all her organs is now saturating every atom of her being, and a river of peace, flows through every cell of her body. The doctors are divinely guided and directed, and whoever touches my mother is guided to do the right thing. I know that disease has no ultimate reality; if it had, no one could be healed. I now align myself with the infinite principle of love and life, and I know and decree that harmony, health, and peace are now being expressed in my mother’s body.” She
